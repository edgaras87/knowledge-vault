Container Networking (the hallway between containers) \u00b6 Each container lives in its own isolated network namespace. They can communicate when they share a Docker network . Bridge network (default): Containers can reach each other via IP, but not by name unless you define a user network. User-defined network (recommended): docker network create mynet docker run -d --name db --network mynet mysql:8.4 docker run -d --name app --network mynet myapp Now app can reach db simply at hostname db:3306 . Ports and host access: docker run -p 8080 :80 nginx Maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 inside the container. \u2705 Best practice: Use Docker networks for container-to-container comms. Expose ports only when the host or outside world must connect. \ud83e\uddf0 4.

Instead of one background service ( dockerd ) managing everything, Podman runs containers as regular Linux processes owned by the user who starts them. It fully supports the OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards, meaning: Docker and Podman use the same image format. You can pull from the same registries ( docker.io , quay.io , ghcr.io , etc.). Images built by one work in the other. Podman can manage: Single containers Groups of containers (called Pods ) Containers as systemd services via Quadlet \ud83e\uddf1 The Big Architectural Difference \u00b6 Concept Docker Podman Daemon Central background process ( dockerd ) Daemonless \u2014 every container is a direct child process Privileges Root daemon (even for non-root users) Rootless by default \u2014 containers run under your own UID Socket /var/run/docker.sock Optional: /run/user/$UID/podman/podman.sock Compose Built-in docker compose External tool: podman-compose Pods Docker: only in Kubernetes First-class feature \u2014 group containers like mini-K8s pods System integration Docker runs as service Podman integrates natively with systemd via Quadlet In short: Docker = one big engine. Podman = small, self-contained tools running directly on Linux. \ud83e\udde0 Core Podman Concepts (same as Docker) \u00b6 Image Template for containers, read-only, immutable. Example: podman pull mysql:8.4 Container A running instance of an image. Starts quickly, isolated by namespaces and cgroups. Example: podman run -d --name mysql mysql:8.4 Volume Persistent data storage \u2014 survives container deletion. Example: podman volume create mysql-data Ports Expose container ports to the host. Example: -p 8080:80 \u2192 access on localhost:8080 . Containerfile Same as Dockerfile, just name-neutral. Example: podman build -t myapp . Compose Use podman-compose (separate package) to run multi-container stacks. \u2699\ufe0f Podman Basics \u2014 Command Equivalents \u00b6 Task Docker Podman Run container docker run -d nginx podman run -d nginx List containers docker ps podman ps Stop container docker stop nginx podman stop nginx Remove container docker rm nginx podman rm nginx View logs docker logs nginx podman logs nginx Inspect docker inspect nginx podman inspect nginx View images docker images podman images Build image docker build -t app . podman build -t app . They\u2019re nearly identical \u2014 Podman was intentionally built to be CLI-compatible. \ud83e\uddcd Rootless Containers (Podman\u2019s Superpower) \u00b6 By default, Podman runs containers without root privileges \u2014 each container runs inside a user namespace , isolated from the real system. You don\u2019t need sudo . You can run multiple user-isolated container sets on the same machine. Security improves because even a breakout from the container stays inside your user sandbox. Example: podman run --rm -it alpine sh \u2192 Runs as your own user, not root. Inside the container, you appear as root \u2014 but it\u2019s mapped to your normal UID on the host. \ud83e\udde9 Pods \u2014 Built-in Kubernetes-Style Grouping \u00b6 A Pod is a group of containers that share the same network and storage namespace. Example: podman pod create --name webpod -p 8080 :80 podman run -d --pod webpod nginx podman run -d --pod webpod redis Now both nginx and redis share the same network \u2014 just like a Kubernetes pod. You can inspect: podman pod ps podman pod inspect webpod Use pods when you want tight coupling between containers (e.g., app + sidecar). \ud83e\uddf0 Systemd Integration \u2014 Quadlet \u00b6 Podman talks natively with systemd , which means your containers can become permanent user or system services. You don\u2019t write systemctl start podman \u2014 instead, you drop a .container or .pod file in your systemd config. Example: ~/.config/containers/systemd/mysql.container [Container] Image = mysql:8.4 PublishPort = 3306:3306 Env = MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root Volume = mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql [Install] WantedBy = default.target Enable it: systemctl --user daemon-reload systemctl --user enable --now mysql.service Podman + Quadlet replaces the Docker daemon entirely \u2014 systemd manages the container lifecycle. \ud83e\ude84 Compose (Multi-Container Dev Environments) \u00b6 Podman doesn\u2019t bundle Compose by default, but you can install podman-compose . It uses the same docker-compose.yml files . Example: podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d podman-compose down That means all your old Compose projects (MySQL + backend + Nginx) run untouched. Behind the scenes, it creates pods for you automatically. \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Networking (Under the Hood) \u00b6 Podman uses CNI plugins to manage networking. Containers on the same pod share the same network namespace. For external exposure, use -p hostPort:containerPort just like Docker. Example: podman run -d -p 8080 :80 nginx To connect multiple containers: podman network create appnet podman run -d --network appnet --name db mysql:8.4 podman run -d --network appnet --name app backend:latest They can talk to each other via db:3306 , just like in Docker networks. \ud83d\udce6 Volumes and Storage \u00b6 Persistent data works the same way as Docker, but stored under your user directory for rootless containers. podman volume create mysql-data podman run -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql mysql:8.4 List and inspect volumes: podman volume ls podman volume inspect mysql-data \ud83d\udd10 Security & Isolation \u00b6 Rootless mode prevents host compromise. Supports SELinux , AppArmor , and seccomp natively. You can drop capabilities, restrict syscalls, or limit resources: podman run --cap-drop = ALL --read-only nginx * Default network isolation is tighter than Docker\u2019s, but can be configured. \ud83e\uddf9 Maintenance & Cleanup \u00b6 podman ps -a podman images podman system prune -a Equivalent to Docker \u2014 just without daemon interaction. \u26a1 Quick Comparison Summary \u00b6 Feature Docker Podman Daemon Required ( dockerd ) None Rootless mode Partial Default Compose Built-in Separate tool ( podman-compose ) Pods No Yes systemd integration Indirect Native (Quadlet) Socket API /var/run/docker.sock Optional ( podman.sock ) CLI commands docker podman (or use podman-docker alias) \ud83e\udded Mental Model \u00b6 Think of Docker as \u201cone big boss\u201d (the daemon) that manages your containers for you. Think of Podman as \u201cdirect control\u201d \u2014 you manage containers like regular Linux processes, optionally grouped into pods and controlled by systemd. You lose the babysitter daemon, but you gain: Simpler architecture Rootless safety Native system integration Kubernetes-aligned concepts (pods, Quadlet) \ud83e\udde9 Example Setup (MySQL + Backend) \u00b6 docker-compose.yml still works unchanged: services : mysql : image : mysql:8.4 environment : MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD : root MYSQL_DATABASE : appdb ports : - \"3306:3306\" volumes : - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql backend : image : backend:latest depends_on : - mysql environment : SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL : jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/appdb SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME : root SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD : root ports : - \"8080:8080\" volumes : mysql_data : Run it: podman-compose up -d \u2705 Rule of Thumb \u00b6 Everything you know from Docker works here. The key differences: No daemon (each container is its own process). Rootless by default. Pods and Quadlet add system-level flexibility. Compose exists separately but behaves the same. Podman is Docker\u2019s spiritual successor \u2014 same workflow, just stripped of the daemon and built with Linux-native elegance.","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Podman Quickstart"},{"location":"cheatsheets/containers/quickstart/podman/#simple-guide-to-podman-and-containers","text":"","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Simple Guide to Podman and Containers"},{"location":"cheatsheets/containers/quickstart/podman/#what-podman-is","text":"Podman (\u201cPod Manager\u201d) is a container engine \u2014 just like Docker \u2014 but it runs without a daemon .

It stores data as key-value pairs , keeps it in RAM for near-instant access, and can optionally persist it to disk. It\u2019s often used alongside PostgreSQL: Postgres for durability, Redis for speed. \u2699\ufe0f 1. What Redis Actually Does \u00b6 Redis keeps everything in memory but optionally syncs to disk (snapshots or append logs). It supports complex data types, pub/sub messaging, and atomic operations \u2014 all with sub-millisecond latency. Use Case Example Cache Store frequently accessed DB results. Session Store Track logged-in users. Queue / Stream Background jobs, real-time feeds. Rate Limiter Count requests per user/IP. Pub/Sub Event notification between services. \ud83d\udc49 In short: Redis trades persistence for speed , but can be configured for both. \ud83e\uddf1 2. Core Concepts \u00b6 Concept Description Key Identifier for a piece of data (string). Value Data stored under a key \u2014 can be string, hash, list, set, etc. TTL Time-to-live (expiration). Persistence Data saved to disk (RDB snapshots or AOF logs). Pub/Sub Publisher sends messages to channels; subscribers receive them. Database index Redis has logical DBs numbered 0\u201315 by default. \u26a1 3. Basic Commands (Quick Reference) \u00b6 redis-cli # Start CLI ping # \u2192 PONG set key \"value\" # store get key # retrieve del key # delete exists key # check if exists expire key 60 # expire after 60s keys * # list all keys (use with caution) flushall # delete everything ```` --- ## \ud83e\udde9 4.

Persistence Modes \u00b6 Redis can persist data in two main ways: Mode Description RDB (Snapshot) Saves full dataset at intervals (default). Fast, minimal overhead. AOF (Append Only File) Logs every operation \u2014 safer but slower. Hybrid Combines both for speed + durability. Example in redis.conf : save 900 1 save 300 10 save 60 10000 appendonly yes \ud83e\uddf0 6. Running Redis with Docker \u00b6 docker run -d \\ --name redis \\ -p 6379 :6379 \\ -v redis_data:/data \\ redis:7 Check connection: docker exec -it redis redis-cli ping With password: docker run -d \\ -p 6379 :6379 \\ -e REDIS_PASSWORD = secret \\ redis:7 \\ redis-server --requirepass secret \ud83e\udde9 7. Docker Compose Example \u00b6 version : \"3.9\" services : redis : image : redis:7 ports : - \"6379:6379\" volumes : - redis_data:/data command : redis-server --appendonly yes healthcheck : test : [ \"CMD\" , \"redis-cli\" , \"ping\" ] interval : 5s retries : 5 backend : build : ./backend environment : REDIS_HOST : redis REDIS_PORT : 6379 volumes : redis_data : \ud83d\udcbe 8. Redis + Application Integration (Spring Boot Example) \u00b6 application.properties : spring.data.redis.host = redis spring.data.redis.port = 6379 spring.data.redis.password = secret Simple cache usage with Spring: @Cacheable ( \"users\" ) public User getUserById ( Long id ) { return userRepository . findById ( id ). orElseThrow (); } Make sure caching is enabled: @EnableCaching @SpringBootApplication public class App {} \ud83d\udce1 9. Monitoring and Admin Commands \u00b6 info # show metrics dbsize # number of keys monitor # live command log config get * # view config config rewrite # persist config changes slowlog get # show slow commands For real-time dashboards: RedisInsight redis-exporter for Prometheus / Grafana metrics. \ud83d\udd12 10. Security & Performance Best Practices \u00b6 Set a password ( requirepass secret ) \u2014 Redis is open by default. Bind to localhost or internal networks ( bind 127.0.0.1 ). Disable FLUSHALL and CONFIG commands in production. Use connection pooling for app clients. For persistence: prefer AOF + fsync every second . Enable maxmemory and maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru for safe eviction. Example snippet: maxmemory 512mb maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru \ud83d\udcbb 11. IDE & Tool Integration \u00b6 JetBrains IDEs \u00b6 Use built-in Database Tool Window \u2192 Add Data Source \u2192 Redis. Visualize keys, TTLs, and values directly. Supports EVAL and Lua scripting. VS Code \u00b6 Recommended extensions: Redis Explorer \u2192 browse keys, TTLs, and memory usage. REST Client \u2192 test APIs that interact with Redis. .env files \u2192 store connection secrets. Example .env : REDIS_HOST=localhost REDIS_PORT=6379 REDIS_PASSWORD=secret \ud83d\ude80 12. CI/CD Integration Example \u00b6 GitHub Actions \u2014 Redis as test dependency: services : redis : image : redis:7 ports : [ '6379:6379' ] options : >- --health-cmd=\"redis-cli ping\" --health-interval=5s --health-retries=5 steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v4 - name : Run integration tests env : REDIS_HOST : localhost REDIS_PORT : 6379 run : ./gradlew test \ud83e\udde9 13. Real-World Patterns \u00b6 Pattern Description Example Cache-Aside App reads from Redis; on miss, fetches DB + stores in Redis. Common with Spring or Django. Write-Through Writes go to Redis and DB simultaneously. Ensures consistency. Pub/Sub Services communicate via Redis channels. Real-time notifications. Streams Event queue with consumer groups. Great for jobs, analytics. Example stream usage: XADD jobs * type \"email\" user \"alice\" XREADGROUP GROUP workers 1 COUNT 1 STREAMS jobs > \ud83e\udde0 14. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Issue Fix Redis not reachable Check port 6379 and container health. Keys disappear TTL expired or memory eviction triggered. \u201cNOAUTH\u201d error Set password in config and client. High latency Tune maxmemory + eviction policy. Data not persistent Enable appendonly yes . \u2705 15. Summary \u00b6 Redis = speed and simplicity \u2014 an in-memory data store with persistence options.

It\u2019s the database behind everything from small apps to enterprise-scale systems. Think of it as the \u201cdeveloper\u2019s Swiss army knife\u201d for data \u2014 solid, flexible, and endlessly scriptable. \u2699\ufe0f 1. What PostgreSQL Actually Does \u00b6 At its core, Postgres: - Stores structured data in tables (rows and columns). - Enforces relations via keys and constraints. - Lets you query and transform data using SQL . - Runs as a daemon/service on your system or inside a Docker container. - Manages concurrent access safely with MVCC (multi-version concurrency control). \ud83d\udc49 In short: PostgreSQL is a transactional data engine \u2014 designed for consistency, safety, and complex queries. \ud83e\uddf1 2. Core Concepts \u00b6 Concept Description Database Logical container for schemas, tables, and users. Schema Namespace inside a database (like a folder for tables). Table Structured data collection (rows = records, columns = fields). Row / Column Individual data unit / attribute. Primary key Unique identifier per row. Foreign key Relationship link between tables. Transaction Atomic unit of work \u2014 all or nothing. MVCC Allows simultaneous reads/writes safely via versioning. \ud83e\udde9 3. PostgreSQL in Action \u00b6 Start / Stop (Linux) \u00b6 sudo systemctl start postgresql sudo systemctl status postgresql sudo -u postgres psql Quick DB shell commands \u00b6 \\ l -- list databases \\ c mydb -- connect to database \\ dt -- list tables \\ d tablename -- describe table structure \\ q -- quit Create a user and database \u00b6 CREATE USER devuser WITH PASSWORD 'secret' ; CREATE DATABASE devdb OWNER devuser ; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE devdb TO devuser ; \ud83e\uddf0 4. SQL Basics Refresher \u00b6 -- Create table CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY , name VARCHAR ( 100 ), email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL , created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); -- Insert data INSERT INTO users ( name , email ) VALUES ( 'Alice' , 'alice@example.com' ); -- Query data SELECT * FROM users ; SELECT name FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com' ; -- Update UPDATE users SET name = 'Alicia' WHERE id = 1 ; -- Delete DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1 ; \ud83e\udde9 5. PostgreSQL with Docker \u00b6 Simplify local setup \u2014 run everything isolated and disposable. docker run -d \\ --name postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_USER = devuser \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD = secret \\ -e POSTGRES_DB = devdb \\ -p 5432 :5432 \\ -v pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\ postgres:16 Now you can connect from your host or app via: Host: localhost Port: 5432 Database: devdb User: devuser Password: secret Docker Compose Example \u00b6 services : postgres : image : postgres:16 environment : POSTGRES_USER : devuser POSTGRES_PASSWORD : secret POSTGRES_DB : devdb ports : - \"5432:5432\" volumes : - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data pgadmin : image : dpage/pgadmin4 environment : PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL : admin@example.com PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD : admin ports : - \"5050:80\" depends_on : - postgres volumes : pg_data : Access pgAdmin at http://localhost:5050 \u2192 connect to host postgres , port 5432 . \ud83e\udde0 6. Common Data Types \u00b6 Type Example Notes INTEGER 42 Whole numbers SERIAL auto-increment Shortcut for integer + sequence VARCHAR(n) 'Hello' Variable-length string TEXT Long article Unlimited string BOOLEAN TRUE / FALSE Logical flag DATE , TIMESTAMP 2025-10-15 Temporal data JSONB '{\"x\":1}' Binary JSON \u2014 queryable! ARRAY '{1,2,3}' PostgreSQL supports array columns \ud83e\udde9 7. User & Access Management \u00b6 -- Create user CREATE USER api_user WITH PASSWORD 'apipass' ; -- Grant permissions GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE devdb TO api_user ; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO api_user ; GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO api_user ; -- Future tables ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE ON TABLES TO api_user ; \ud83d\udc49 Keep app-level users least-privileged \u2014 don\u2019t give them superuser rights. \ud83e\udde9 8. Useful CLI Commands \u00b6 psql -U devuser -d devdb # connect to DB psql -h localhost -U devuser # specify host pg_dump -U devuser devdb > dump.sql # backup psql -U devuser -d devdb < dump.sql # restore Check service status: sudo systemctl status postgresql \ud83e\uddf0 9. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Issue Fix Can't connect (local) Check pg_hba.conf and open port 5432. \u201crole does not exist\u201d Create user via CREATE USER . Permission denied Ensure grants on database and schema. Docker container forgets data Add a volume: -v pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data . Encoding issues Use UTF8 during DB creation. \ud83e\udde9 10. PostgreSQL Configuration Essentials \u00b6 Main config files (Linux or container): /etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf Common tweaks: listen_addresses = '*' max_connections = 100 shared_buffers = 256MB work_mem = 16MB logging_collector = on log_directory = 'log' Reload without restart: sudo systemctl reload postgresql \ud83d\udcbb 11. PostgreSQL in IDEs (JetBrains / VS Code) \u00b6 JetBrains (DataGrip, IntelliJ Ultimate) \u00b6 Open \u201cDatabase\u201d panel \u2192 \u201c+\u201d \u2192 \u201cPostgreSQL\u201d. Set host/port/user/password. Can run SQL scripts directly, browse schema, or diff databases. Integration with .env variables and Docker Compose services . Shortcut magic: Alt+Enter \u2192 run query under cursor Ctrl+Enter \u2192 run entire script Ctrl+Shift+F10 \u2192 execute file VS Code Setup \u00b6 Extensions to install: SQLTools SQLTools PostgreSQL Driver vscode-database-client (optional GUI) Example .sqltools.json : { \"connections\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Local Postgres\" , \"driver\" : \"PostgreSQL\" , \"previewLimit\" : 50 , \"server\" : \"localhost\" , \"port\" : 5432 , \"database\" : \"devdb\" , \"username\" : \"devuser\" , \"password\" : \"secret\" } ] } Run queries directly in VS Code or integrated terminal. \ud83d\ude80 12. Spring Boot Integration Example \u00b6 In your application.properties : spring.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/devdb spring.datasource.username = devuser spring.datasource.password = secret spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect Docker Compose-friendly URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/devdb \ud83e\udde0 13. Developer Workflow Pattern \u00b6 Start your DB (local or Docker). Connect through IDE or pgAdmin. Run schema migrations (Liquibase/Flyway). Run app \u2192 verify connection. Backup before experimenting. Keep .env variables for credentials: POSTGRES_USER=devuser POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret POSTGRES_DB=devdb POSTGRES_PORT=5432 Load via: export $( grep -v '^#' .env | xargs ) \ud83e\udde9 14. Optimization and Maintenance \u00b6 Analyze & Vacuum VACUUM ANALYZE ; Keeps statistics fresh and space reclaimed. Indexes CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users ( email ); Backups pg_dumpall > full_backup.sql Performance Prefer JSONB for flexible data. Avoid SELECT * in production queries. Tune work_mem , shared_buffers for heavy loads. \u2705 15. Summary \u00b6 PostgreSQL = reliable, standard, and developer-friendly. Use Docker for easy, isolated environments. Use pgAdmin or IDE integration for management. Integrate cleanly with Spring Boot via JDBC. Keep permissions minimal, backups regular, and queries explicit. \ud83d\udcbb 16. PostgreSQL in Developer Workflows (JetBrains & VS Code) \u00b6 Postgres is more than a database service \u2014 it\u2019s part of your daily dev feedback loop . Connecting it tightly to your IDE and environment lets you debug, test, and deploy confidently. \ud83e\udde9 JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ Ultimate / DataGrip / PyCharm Pro) \u00b6 Action Description Add Data Source \u2192 PostgreSQL Connect via host/port or directly through Docker Compose service. Run SQL scripts inline Execute queries from .sql files, see live results. Compare Schemas Diff local vs. remote DB structures (great for migrations). Generate DDL from tables Auto-create SQL definitions for export or review. Inspect Query Plan (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) Visualize query performance via EXPLAIN ANALYZE . Quick habit loop: 1. Write query \u2192 Alt+Enter \u2192 Run. 2. Fix slow query \u2192 Inspect execution plan. 3. Save snippet in IDE\u2019s \u201cScratch File\u201d for reuse. You can connect directly to your Dockerized DB by pointing to host localhost:5432 or service name postgres inside Compose. \ud83e\udde0 VS Code Integration \u00b6 Recommended extensions: - SQLTools + SQLTools PostgreSQL Driver \u2192 simple queries, table explorer. - Database Client \u2192 visual schema browsing. - .env support \u2192 use environment variables for credentials. Connect via .sqltools.json : { \"connections\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Local Postgres\" , \"driver\" : \"PostgreSQL\" , \"server\" : \"localhost\" , \"port\" : 5432 , \"database\" : \"devdb\" , \"username\" : \"devuser\" , \"password\" : \"secret\" } ] } ```` You ca n ru n a n d test queries direc tl y i n `.sql` f iles wi t hou t swi t chi n g t ools. --- ## \ud83e\uddf0 17.

Healthchecks prevent dependent containers from starting too early. \ud83d\udc49 You can link your backend app to postgres (dev) or testdb (CI) just by switching env variables. \ud83d\ude80 18. Integration with CI/CD (GitHub Actions Example) \u00b6 name : Backend Tests on : [ push , pull_request ] jobs : test : runs-on : ubuntu-latest services : postgres : image : postgres:16 env : POSTGRES_USER : testuser POSTGRES_PASSWORD : testpass POSTGRES_DB : testdb ports : [ '5432:5432' ] options : >- --health-cmd=\"pg_isready -U testuser -d testdb\" --health-interval=5s --health-timeout=5s --health-retries=5 steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v4 - name : Wait for Postgres run : | until pg_isready -h localhost -U testuser; do sleep 1 done - name : Run Tests run : ./gradlew test env : SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL : jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/testdb SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME : testuser SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD : testpass This pattern runs Postgres automatically for tests \u2014 no manual setup, no external dependencies. \ud83e\udde9 19. Managing Environments: Local \u2192 Staging \u2192 Production \u00b6 Environment separation rule: Keep configuration externalized ( .env , configmaps , or Secrets). Never commit real passwords or keys. Distinguish database URLs by environment: Environment Example URL Notes Local jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/devdb Docker or local install Staging jdbc:postgresql://staging-db.internal:5432/appdb Shared test data Production jdbc:postgresql://prod-db.cluster:5432/appdb High availability In Docker Compose: env_file : - .env.${ENVIRONMENT} In Spring Boot: spring.datasource.url = ${DB_URL} spring.datasource.username = ${DB_USER} spring.datasource.password = ${DB_PASS} Pro tip: version .env.example for onboarding new developers easily. \ud83d\udd12 20. Production Hardening & Maintenance Patterns \u00b6 Connection Pooling \u00b6 Postgres performs best with connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer ). docker run -d \\ --name pgbouncer \\ -p 6432 :6432 \\ -e DB_USER = devuser \\ -e DB_PASSWORD = secret \\ -e DB_HOST = postgres \\ edoburu/pgbouncer App connects to localhost:6432 instead of 5432 . Backups \u00b6 pg_dump -U devuser devdb | gzip > backup_ $( date +%F ) .sql.gz Automate via cron or CI. Replication and Scaling \u00b6 Use Streaming Replication for read replicas. Or scale horizontally via logical replication . Consider Patroni or TimescaleDB for high-availability setups. Security \u00b6 Disable remote superuser login.

Clear Separation of Concerns \u00b6 Core Java concepts live in core/ \u2014 language fundamentals. Frameworks (Spring, Micronaut, Quarkus) live under frameworks/ . Each gets its own namespace. Build tools (Maven, Gradle) belong to build/ , since they\u2019re language-tied. Testing tools (JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers) share a top-level folder \u2014 they cross all projects. 2. Scalable and Future-Proof \u00b6 Spring starts as the main resident of frameworks/ . Micronaut and Quarkus get empty placeholders now \u2014 ready for future growth. If Spring grows large, subdivide it ( boot/ , web/ , data/ , security/ , testing/ ). 3. Flexibility for JVM Ecosystem \u00b6 If you later add Kotlin or Scala, they\u2019ll live beside Java under languages/ . Common JVM topics (like Gradle multi-language builds) can move to docs/concepts/build-systems.md for shared knowledge. \ud83d\ude80 Evolution Notes \u00b6 Keep the first version simple \u2014 start with core/ , setup/ , and frameworks/spring/boot/ . As you expand, let structure follow growth , not theory. When duplication or overlap emerges between frameworks, extract those notes into: docs/concepts/frameworks/java-frameworks-comparison.md \ud83d\udca1 Philosophy \u00b6 A good cheatsheet library grows organically , not architecturally.

This is how frameworks discover , introspect , and instantiate things dynamically. 1. The Big Picture: Type \u2192 Bytecode \u2192 Class<?> \u2192 Object \u00b6 source (.java) \u2193 compiler bytecode (.class) \u2193 classloader Class<?> object in Metaspace \u2193 reflection runtime instances on Heap Class<?> lives in Metaspace , managed by a ClassLoader . Object lives on the Heap. Each loaded .class file gets exactly one Class object. Class<?> is like a mirror that describes structure and behavior. 2. Getting a Class<?> Reference \u00b6 Expression Description User.class Compile-time literal reference. Fast, safe, no reflection. obj.getClass() Runtime instance \u2192 class object of its type. Class.forName(\"com.example.User\") Dynamically load by fully qualified name (string). Throws ClassNotFoundException . ClassLoader.loadClass(\"...\") Lower-level control (no static init triggered). int.class , void.class , String[].class Works for primitives and arrays too. Example: Class <?> clazz = Class . forName ( \"com.example.model.User\" ); System . out . println ( clazz . getName ()); // com.example.model.User System . out . println ( clazz . getPackageName ()); // com.example.model 3. Why <?> ? \u00b6 Class is generic since Java 5: Class<T> . It tells the compiler what type this Class object represents. Examples: Class < String > stringClass = String . class ; Class <? extends Number > numClass = Integer . class ; // The wildcard form: Class<?> means \"Class of some type, unknown at compile-time\". void printClassInfo ( Class <?> c ) { System . out . println ( \"Name: \" + c . getName ()); } So: Use Class<T> when you know the type (compile-time safety). Use Class<?> when you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care which type (runtime flexibility). 4. What You Can Do with It \u00b6 a) Inspect Structure \u00b6 Class <?> c = User . class ; System . out . println ( c . getSimpleName ()); // User System . out . println ( c . getSuperclass ()); // class java.lang.Object for ( var f : c . getDeclaredFields ()) System . out . println ( f . getName ()); for ( var m : c . getDeclaredMethods ()) System . out . println ( m . getName ()); You can fetch: getFields() \u2192 only public fields (inherited too) getDeclaredFields() \u2192 all fields in that class Same for methods, constructors, annotations b) Create Instances \u00b6 Class <?> c = Class . forName ( \"com.example.User\" ); Object instance = c . getConstructor ( String . class , String . class ) . newInstance ( \"42\" , \"Alice\" ); Equivalent to new User(\"42\", \"Alice\") , but at runtime. Used heavily by Spring , Jackson , JPA , etc. c) Access Fields \u00b6 Field f = c . getDeclaredField ( \"name\" ); f . setAccessible ( true ); // bypass private Object value = f . get ( instance ); System . out . println ( \"Name: \" + value ); d) Call Methods \u00b6 Method m = c . getDeclaredMethod ( \"setName\" , String . class ); m . setAccessible ( true ); m . invoke ( instance , \"Bob\" ); e) Annotations \u00b6 Annotation [] anns = c . getAnnotations (); for ( var a : anns ) System . out . println ( a . annotationType (). getSimpleName ()); Frameworks like Spring use this to detect @Component , @Controller , etc. 5. Class Object Internals \u00b6 Property Example / Meaning getName() \"com.example.User\" getSimpleName() \"User\" getTypeName() \"com.example.User\" isInterface() false isEnum() false isRecord() false (Java 16+) isArray() false isAnnotation() false getPackage() Package com.example getModifiers() use Modifier.toString() to decode flags getClassLoader() reveals which loader brought it in (Bootstrap, App, custom) 6. Arrays and Primitives \u00b6 Every primitive and array also has a Class<?> : System . out . println ( int . class ); // int System . out . println ( int [] . class ); // class [I System . out . println ( String [][] . class ); // class [[Ljava.lang.String; You can inspect component type: Class <?> arr = String [] . class ; System . out . println ( arr . getComponentType ()); // class java.lang.String 7. The ClassLoader Connection \u00b6 Each Class<?> is bound to one ClassLoader . If two different classloaders load the same .class bytes \u2014 they are different types to the JVM. ClassLoader loader = c . getClassLoader (); System . out . println ( loader . getName ()); This isolation is how Servlet containers , Spring Boot , or plugins keep separate worlds of classes. 8. Generics & Class<T> \u00b6 You can use type-safe factories: public static < T > T create ( Class < T > type ) throws ReflectiveOperationException { return type . getDeclaredConstructor (). newInstance (); } User u = create ( User . class ); // returns real User Here type carries the exact class into runtime \u2014 no need to cast. 9. Class Literals Everywhere \u00b6 Switch key for reflection-based APIs: mapper . readValue ( json , User . class ); Frameworks use the .class literal to: Parse generically typed data ( T ). Construct instances using reflection. Store type info for dependency injection or serialization. 10. Class<?> vs Object vs ClassLoader \u00b6 Concept Lives in Represents Created by Used for Object Heap instance new data & behavior Class<?> Metaspace type metadata ClassLoader reflection & discovery ClassLoader Heap code source JVM / user code loading .class \u2192 Class<?> Think: Object is a house; Class<?> is the blueprint; ClassLoader is the truck that brought it. 11. When You See It in Frameworks \u00b6 Framework How it uses Class<?> Spring Scans packages for annotations \u2192 builds beans via Class<?> . JPA/Hibernate Maps entity classes by introspection ( @Entity , @Id ). Jackson Needs Class<?> to know what to deserialize JSON into. JUnit Loads test classes reflectively, invokes annotated methods. ServiceLoader Loads service implementations via META-INF \u2192 returns Class<?> handles. In short: Class<?> is the entry point for framework magic . 12. Class<?> and Type Erasure \u00b6 Generics vanish at runtime \u2014 the JVM only knows the raw type. List < String > . class ; // \u274c illegal Class <?> c = List . class ; // \u2705 only raw type available That\u2019s why frameworks sometimes need extra info ( TypeToken , ParameterizedTypeReference ). 13. Class Objects Are Singleton per Loader \u00b6 Class < User > a = User . class ; Class <?> b = Class . forName ( \"com.example.User\" ); System . out . println ( a == b ); // true Equality check works: Class<?> is unique within its ClassLoader . 14. Safe Reflection Practices \u00b6 Prefer .class literal over forName() when possible. Catch specific exceptions: ClassNotFoundException , NoSuchMethodException . Minimize use of setAccessible(true) \u2014 it breaks encapsulation and modules. Cache reflected access for performance (like frameworks do). Use libraries (Jackson, Spring) rather than manual reflection when possible. 15. Bonus: Type , ParameterizedType , and Friends \u00b6 Class<?> is just one implementation of java.lang.reflect.Type . Others include: ParameterizedType \u2192 List<String> GenericArrayType \u2192 T[] WildcardType \u2192 ? extends Number Used in generic introspection , e.g. Spring\u2019s ResolvableType or Gson\u2019s TypeToken . 16. Debug Trick \u00b6 Print a class hierarchy at runtime: static void printHierarchy ( Class <?> c ) { while ( c != null ) { System . out . println ( c . getName ()); c = c . getSuperclass (); } } Or list interfaces: System . out . println ( Arrays . toString ( String . class . getInterfaces ())); 17. Quick Reference Summary \u00b6 Task Method Name getName() , getSimpleName() Superclass getSuperclass() Interfaces getInterfaces() Annotations getAnnotations() Fields getDeclaredFields() Methods getDeclaredMethods() Constructors getDeclaredConstructors() New Instance getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance() ClassLoader getClassLoader() 18. When to Use Class<?> Explicitly \u00b6 \u2705 When writing generic utilities: public static void debug ( Class <?> c ) { ... } \u2705 When storing heterogeneous type metadata: Map < String , Class <?>> typeMap = Map . of ( \"user\" , User . class , \"order\" , Order . class ); \u2705 When building reflection-based frameworks or serialization systems. 19. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Confusing User.class (type literal) with user.getClass() (instance\u2019s runtime type). Forgetting checked exceptions around forName() and newInstance() . Using wrong constructor signatures. Expecting generics info from Class (it doesn\u2019t store it \u2014 use Type ). Assuming equality across classloaders ( == may be false if loaded twice). 20. Final Mind Model \u00b6 Source code \u2192 compiled \u2192 loaded User.java \u2193 \u2193 bytecode (.class) \u2192 Class<User> \u2192 used by Spring, JPA, etc. Object user = new User(); // data Class<?> meta = user.getClass(); // blueprint ClassLoader sys = meta.getClassLoader(); // brings it in That triangle \u2014 Object \u2194 Class \u2194 ClassLoader \u2014 is the beating heart of Java\u2019s runtime reflection model. Heck yes\u2014let\u2019s \u201cfull-methodify\u201d Class<?> the same way. Below is a drop-in appendix that turns your class-classobject.md into a complete, Javadoc-level quick-ref . I\u2019m grouping by intent, calling out Java-version quirks, and noting the gotchas frameworks rely on. 21. \ud83d\udd0e Full Method Coverage \u00b6 Goal: cover all the stuff you\u2019ll actually touch plus the rare but important edges that show up in frameworks, modules, enums, records, and arrays. 1) Identity, Names, and Modifiers \u00b6 Method What it returns Notes / Traps getName() JVM binary name Arrays/prim: \"[I\" , \"[Ljava.lang.String;\" getTypeName() Friendly name Often equals canonical for most types; arrays pretty-prints ( int[] ) getCanonicalName() Canonical source-ish name or null null for anonymous/local classes and some arrays getSimpleName() Unqualified name Anonymous \u2192 \"\" ; local adds $1 -style in getName() but not here getPackage() / getPackageName() Package / String getPackageName() is Java 9+ getModifiers() int bitset Use Modifier.toString(...) isInterface() isEnum() isRecord() isAnnotation() booleans isRecord() Java 16+ isPrimitive() isArray() booleans int.class.isPrimitive() \u2192 true getComponentType() Class<?> or null Arrays only Name formats cheat: Primitive: int.class.getName() \u2192 \"int\" 1D array of int: \"[I\" ; of String: \"[Ljava.lang.String;\" 2) Hierarchy & Relationships \u00b6 Method Use getSuperclass() null for Object , interfaces, primitives, and void getInterfaces() Direct interfaces only getGenericSuperclass() / getGenericInterfaces() Keep generic info (use with ParameterizedType ) asSubclass(Class<U>) Safe downcast for Class objects (throws ClassCastException on mismatch) cast(Object) Runtime cast using this class as the type token isAssignableFrom(Class<?>) Classic \u201cis-a\u201d test for types 3) Members: Fields, Methods, Ctors (Declared vs Public) \u00b6 Family Public (incl. inherited) Declared (this class only) Fields getFields() getDeclaredFields() Methods getMethods() getDeclaredMethods() Constructors getConstructors() getDeclaredConstructors() Singles getField(String) / getMethod(String, \u2026) / getConstructor(\u2026 ) getDeclaredField(String) / getDeclaredMethod(String, \u2026) / getDeclaredConstructor(\u2026 ) Why it matters: frameworks overwhelmingly use the declared variants, then set accessibility on AccessibleObject . 4) Construction & Instantiation \u00b6 Method Status Use getDeclaredConstructor(\u2026\u200b).newInstance(args\u2026) \u2705 Preferred since Java 9 (throws specific checked exceptions) newInstance() \u274c Deprecated Avoid: no args only, poor exception signaling Tip: favor getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance() and cache the Constructor<?> for speed. 5) Annotations \u00b6 Method Scope Repeats? getAnnotations() Public + inherited (class\u2010level) Yes getDeclaredAnnotations() Declared on this class only Yes getAnnotation(Class<A>) Single lookup (honors @Inherited ) \u2014 getDeclaredAnnotation(Class<A>) Single lookup (no inheritance) \u2014 getAnnotationsByType(Class<A>) Repeating annotations merged Yes getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class<A>) Repeating on this class only Yes Remember: @Inherited works only on class annotations and only via getAnnotation* . 6) Enclosing/Nesting (Local, Anonymous, Member classes) \u00b6 Method Purpose isMemberClass() Nested static /inner declared in another class isLocalClass() / isAnonymousClass() Inside a method / anonymous new Interface(){} getEnclosingClass() The class lexically enclosing this one getEnclosingMethod() / getEnclosingConstructor() For local/anonymous getDeclaringClass() For member classes (not local/anonymous) These differentiate real API types from compiler tricks\u2014handy for robust classpath scanners. 7) Enums, Records, Sealed \u00b6 Feature Methods Enums getEnumConstants() (may return null ), isEnum() Records (Java 16+) isRecord() , getRecordComponents() (then RecordComponent \u2192 name, type, accessor) Sealed (Java 17+) isSealed() , getPermittedSubclasses() Frameworks (Jackson, Spring) often use record components to bind constructor params. 8) Modules & ClassLoader \u00b6 Method What getModule() java.lang.Module of this class getClassLoader() May be null for bootstrap-loaded types desiredAssertionStatus() Oldschool; rarely used getClassLoader()==null \u2192 Bootstrap (e.g., String.class ). 9) Reflection + Types Ecosystem \u00b6 Class<?> implements Type . Related reflective types: TypeVariable , ParameterizedType , WildcardType , GenericArrayType Use when you need generic info (e.g., List<String> field). Helpers frequently paired with Class<?> : java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(componentType, length) for arrays Array.get/Array.set for reflective array ops 10) Loading & Initialization Semantics \u00b6 API Behavior Class.forName(String) Loads and initializes the class using the caller\u2019s loader (JLS rules) Class.forName(String, boolean initialize, ClassLoader loader) Fine-grained control: choose loader and whether to trigger <clinit> ClassLoader.loadClass(name) Loads but does not initialize; initialization occurs on first active use Rule of thumb: If you don\u2019t want static initializers yet, use the 3-arg forName(..., false, loader) or the loader\u2019s loadClass(...) . 11) Packages & Sealing (legacy but still around) \u00b6 Method Notes getPackage() / getPackageName() Package metadata/name Package \u201csealing\u201d Managed via Package / Manifest ; rare today, but some old libs still check it 12) Equality, Identity, and Class Objects \u00b6 Singleton per loader: For a given loader, there is exactly one Class<?> for a type. a == b works as identity test for the same type in the same loader. Same bytes loaded by different loaders \u2192 different types (will bite you with ClassCastException: X cannot be cast to X ). 13) Performance Notes (pragmatic) \u00b6 Cache reflective lookups ( Field , Method , Constructor )\u2014frameworks do. Avoid repeated setAccessible(true) calls; batch and cache. If crossing module boundaries, consider opens / --add-opens or MethodHandles for faster, legal access. 14) Mini \u201cWhen To Use What\u201d Map \u00b6 Compile-time known type : carry Class<T> and use generics ( T create(Class<T> t) ). Heterogeneous registry : Map<String, Class<?>> keyed by name/alias. Framework glue : prefer getDeclared*() + accessibility controls. Generic shapes : leave Class<?> and jump to Type / ParameterizedType when you need List<Foo> fidelity. 15) Quick-Ref Table \u00b6 Task Snippet Get friendly name c.getSimpleName() / c.getTypeName() Super + interfaces c.getSuperclass() , c.getInterfaces() Public vs declared methods c.getMethods() vs c.getDeclaredMethods() New instance (safe) c.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance() Specific ctor c.getDeclaredConstructor(Arg1.class, Arg2.class) Field/method by name c.getDeclaredField(\"x\") , c.getDeclaredMethod(\"m\", P.class) Annotation lookup c.getAnnotation(Foo.class) / getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Foo.class) Array component c.getComponentType() Cast a value T v = k.cast(obj); Downcast Class Class<? extends U> cu = c.asSubclass(U.class) Module / loader c.getModule() , c.getClassLoader() Enum constants c.getEnumConstants() 16) Canonical Pitfalls (and the fix) \u00b6 Expecting generics from Class \u2192 doesn\u2019t exist; use Field.getGenericType() or Method.getGenericReturnType() . Using newInstance() \u2192 stop; use constructors. Class not initialized when you thought \u2192 check forName(..., init, loader) vs loadClass(...) . Comparing types across loaders \u2192 your == may be false; compare names + packages + loader identity .","title":"Class<?>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/classes/Class/#class-the-meta-class-cheatsheet","text":"Essence: Every Java type (class, interface, enum, record, array, primitive) has one single Class object in the JVM \u2014 a runtime handle to its metadata.

It tells the JVM where to find classes and how to bring them into memory. Every class in Java \u2014 from String to your own \u2014 is loaded by exactly one ClassLoader . 1. The Journey: From Source to Runtime \u00b6 source (.java) \u2193 compiled by javac bytecode (.class) \u2193 loaded by ClassLoader \u2193 defined in Class<?> (Metaspace) \u2193 instantiated into Object (Heap) ClassLoader \u2192 reads raw bytecode. Class<?> \u2192 the runtime representation of that type. Object \u2192 the actual instance living on the heap. 2. The Loading Chain \u2014 Delegation Model \u00b6 Java\u2019s loaders form a hierarchy \u2014 each loader delegates to its parent before loading itself. BootstrapClassLoader \u2191 PlatformClassLoader (JDK APIs) \u2191 AppClassLoader (your code & libs) \u2191 Custom Loaders (plugins, frameworks) This model prevents multiple copies of core classes like java.lang.Object . Only the top-most loader (Bootstrap) defines them once for the entire JVM. 3. The Classpath \u2014 The Loader\u2019s Search Map \u00b6 The classpath is not a directory \u2014 it\u2019s a runtime search list that tells the Application ClassLoader where to find .class and .jar files. When you run a Java program: java -cp \"out/:libs/*\" com.example.Main ```` or equivalently: ``` bash export CLASSPATH = out/:libs/* java com.example.Main the JVM passes that list to the AppClassLoader , which searches those paths in order. How the Classpath Works \u00b6 Linux/macOS \u2192 entries separated by : Windows \u2192 entries separated by ; Each entry can be: a directory (searched recursively by package path) a JAR file a wildcard ( * ) \u2014 includes all JARs in a directory Example: /project/out:/project/lib/*:/opt/javafx/lib/* You can inspect your runtime classpath with: System . out . println ( System . getProperty ( \"java.class.path\" )); Classpath vs Module Path \u00b6 Aspect Classpath (Traditional) Module Path (Java 9+) Used by AppClassLoader Module system (JPMS) Structure Flat list of dirs/JARs Graph of named modules Dependency visibility All-to-all Explicit requires / exports Common usage Spring, legacy apps, tools Modular apps, JLink runtimes Even modular apps still rely on the ClassLoader mechanism under the hood \u2014 modules just add structure on top. Quick Gotchas \u00b6 Wrong or missing classpath \u2192 ClassNotFoundException java -jar ignores -cp unless the JAR\u2019s manifest defines Class-Path IDEs and build tools (Maven, Gradle, IntelliJ) construct the classpath automatically Visual Summary \u00b6 +----------------------+ | Classpath | \u2190 directories & JARs +----------------------+ \u2193 AppClassLoader \u2193 JVM Runtime 4. Built-in ClassLoaders \u00b6 Loader Loads From Access in Code Example Classes Bootstrap Core JDK ( rt.jar / modules) null (native) java.lang.* , java.util.* Platform (Extension) jre/lib/ext (old) or JDK modules ClassLoader.getPlatformClassLoader() java.sql.* , java.xml.* Application (System) CLASSPATH / modulepath ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() your app & dependencies Custom Anywhere you define Subclass of ClassLoader plugins, agents, hot-reloaders Example: ClassLoader app = ClassLoader . getSystemClassLoader (); System . out . println ( app ); // AppClassLoader System . out . println ( app . getParent ()); // PlatformClassLoader System . out . println ( app . getParent (). getParent ()); // null (Bootstrap) 5. How Class Loading Works Internally \u00b6 Each class passes through these phases: Loading \u2014 read bytes from .class , JAR, or network. Linking \u2014 Verification : bytecode safety checks. Preparation : allocate static fields. Resolution : replace symbolic refs with direct ones. Initialization \u2014 run static blocks and field initializers. You can intercept loading by overriding findClass(name) . 6. Relationship with Class<?> \u00b6 Every loaded class has an associated Class<?> object that remembers its loader. Class <?> c = User . class ; System . out . println ( c . getClassLoader ()); // AppClassLoader If two identical classes are loaded by different loaders \u2192 they are different types to the JVM: boolean same = classA == classB ; // false if loaded by different ClassLoaders That\u2019s why app servers (Tomcat, Spring Boot) can isolate multiple apps with identical class names. 7. Writing a Custom ClassLoader \u00b6 public class MyLoader extends ClassLoader { @Override protected Class <?> findClass ( String name ) throws ClassNotFoundException { try { byte [] bytes = Files . readAllBytes ( Path . of ( name . replace ( '.' , '/' ) + \".class\" )); return defineClass ( name , bytes , 0 , bytes . length ); } catch ( IOException e ) { throw new ClassNotFoundException ( name , e ); } } } Usage: ClassLoader loader = new MyLoader (); Class <?> c = loader . loadClass ( \"com.example.Hello\" ); Object instance = c . getDeclaredConstructor (). newInstance (); 8. loadClass() vs findClass() \u00b6 Method Role loadClass(name) Handles delegation (calls parent first). findClass(name) Defines how your loader finds the class. If you override findClass() , always call super.loadClass(name, false) first to respect delegation. 9. Why Custom Loaders Exist \u00b6 Purpose Example Hot reloading Spring DevTools, JRebel Plugin isolation Tomcat webapps, OSGi Dynamic bytecode Hibernate proxies, generated classes Security / sandboxing Applets, custom interpreters 10. Metaspace: Where Classes Live \u00b6 Pre-Java 8: PermGen held class metadata. Since Java 8: Metaspace (native memory). Stores each loaded class\u2019s structure, methods, constants. Classes unload only when: No live references remain, and Their loader is garbage collected. Long-lived custom loaders can leak memory if they hold on to objects. 11. Loading From Different Sources \u00b6 You can load classes from anywhere \u2014 filesystem, JARs, or network. URL [] urls = { new URL ( \"file:/path/to/lib.jar\" ) }; URLClassLoader loader = new URLClassLoader ( urls ); Class <?> c = loader . loadClass ( \"com.lib.Tool\" ); Close it when done: loader . close (); // releases JAR handles 12. Debugging & Introspection \u00b6 Check which loader loaded a class: System . out . println ( String . class . getClassLoader ()); // null (Bootstrap) System . out . println ( User . class . getClassLoader ()); // AppClassLoader List all URLs in the system loader: URLClassLoader cl = ( URLClassLoader ) ClassLoader . getSystemClassLoader (); for ( URL url : cl . getURLs ()) System . out . println ( url ); Print the loader hierarchy: static void printHierarchy ( ClassLoader cl ) { while ( cl != null ) { System . out . println ( cl ); cl = cl . getParent (); } } 13. Class Unloading Rules \u00b6 A class can be unloaded only when: Its defining ClassLoader is unreachable. No live instances of that class remain. No reflective references ( Class<?> ) survive. In long-lived servers, leaked loaders = leaked memory . 14. Real-World Hierarchies \u00b6 Spring Boot Fat JAR: AppClassLoader \u21b3 LaunchedURLClassLoader (Spring Boot custom) \u21b3 PluginClassLoader (optional) Tomcat: CommonLoader \u21b3 CatalinaLoader (server classes) \u21b3 WebAppLoader (per webapp) Each webapp runs in isolation \u2014 same class names, different loaders. 15. ClassLoader + Reflection \u00b6 Frameworks often pair loaders with reflection: ClassLoader cl = Thread . currentThread (). getContextClassLoader (); Class <?> clazz = cl . loadClass ( \"com.example.ServiceImpl\" ); Annotation a = clazz . getAnnotation ( Service . class ); The Thread Context ClassLoader lets frameworks load user classes without hardcoding paths. 16. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Forgetting to close URLClassLoader \u2192 file lock leaks (especially on Windows). Holding references to plugin classes \u2192 prevents GC/unloading. Violating delegation \u2192 LinkageError . Duplicate classes from different loaders \u2192 ClassCastException: X cannot be cast to X . Misusing context loader \u2192 ServiceLoader fails to locate providers. 17. Modern Evolution \u00b6 Java Modules (JPMS) \u2014 adds explicit dependencies; built atop loaders. Instrumentation API \u2014 allows runtime class redefinition. Lookup#defineClass() (Java 15+) \u2014 defines classes without subclassing ClassLoader . 18. The Mental Map \u00b6 [ClassLoader] \u2192 defines \u2192 [Class<?> in Metaspace] \u2191 \u2193 hierarchy used to create \u2191 \u2193 [App/Custom Loaders] [Objects on Heap] Concept Lives In Purpose ClassLoader Heap Loads and defines classes Class<?> Metaspace Metadata for a type Object Heap Runtime instance Classpath JVM property Search map for AppClassLoader Metaspace Native memory Class metadata store 19. Quick Reference \u00b6 Task Code System loader ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() Platform loader ClassLoader.getPlatformClassLoader() Loader of a class MyClass.class.getClassLoader() Get parent loader getParent() Define manually defineClass(name, bytes, 0, len) Close URL loader close() Get classpath System.getProperty(\"java.class.path\") 20.

The classpath feeds it. The ClassLoader enacts it. The JVM sustains it. 21. \ud83d\udd0e Full Method Coverage \u00b6 Below are the main methods grouped by purpose, including those not yet explicitly mentioned in your version. 1. Core Loading Methods \u00b6 Method Description loadClass(String name) Main entry point. Performs parent-delegation before attempting to find the class. Usually not overridden . findClass(String name) Child loader\u2019s lookup logic. Usually overridden in custom loaders. defineClass(String name, byte[] b, int off, int len) Converts raw bytecode \u2192 Class<?> . Also checks security and defines it in the current loader\u2019s namespace. defineClass(String name, ByteBuffer b, ProtectionDomain pd) Same but accepts a ByteBuffer . resolveClass(Class<?> c) Links the class (resolves symbolic references). Often called after defining. findLoadedClass(String name) Checks whether the class has already been loaded by this loader. Useful to prevent re-definition. 2. Resource Lookup (not classes, but files inside JARs / paths) \u00b6 Method Description getResource(String name) Finds a single resource (delegates to parent first). getResources(String name) Returns all matches ( Enumeration<URL> ). getResourceAsStream(String name) Opens resource as stream. Convenient for configs inside JARs. findResource(String name) Child\u2019s own lookup (skip parent). findResources(String name) Same idea, but for multiple results. getResourceAsStream(String name) Handy wrapper combining both. Note: These work for .properties , .xml , images, or anything packaged in classpath/JARs \u2014 not .class files specifically. 3. Classpath / URL Access (via subclasses) \u00b6 Method Description getURLs() (only in URLClassLoader ) \u2014 lists all JARs and directories this loader reads from. addURL(URL url) (protected in URLClassLoader ) \u2014 dynamically extend classpath. close() (since Java 7) \u2014 release open JAR handles (critical on Windows). 4. Context & Hierarchy Methods \u00b6 Method Description getParent() Returns parent loader in the delegation chain. getName() Human-readable name of this loader (Java 9+). getDefinedPackage(String name) Returns metadata for a single package defined by this loader. getDefinedPackages() Returns all packages defined by this loader. setDefaultAssertionStatus(boolean enabled) Controls assertion checking. setPackageAssertionStatus(String pkg, boolean enabled) Per-package assertions. setClassAssertionStatus(String className, boolean enabled) Per-class assertions. clearAssertionStatus() Resets all assertion settings. These assertion methods were added when Java introduced assert \u2014 rarely used today, but still valid. 5. Security & ProtectionDomain \u00b6 Method Description getDefinedPackage(String name) Returns info about the package and its signing/sealing metadata. definePackage(...) Defines a package with attributes (version, vendor, sealBase). getPackage(String name) Legacy method (pre-Java 9). Returns info if the package was already defined. getPackages() Legacy variant returning all loaded packages. getSystemResource(String name) / getSystemResourceAsStream(String name) Static utility methods using the system classloader . 6. Thread Context Loader Utilities \u00b6 Method Description Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() Retrieves the loader used for reflection, frameworks, and service loading. Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(loader) Temporarily changes loader for current thread. Used heavily by Spring, Hibernate, and ServiceLoader . Not part of ClassLoader class itself, but conceptually essential. 7. Internal / Advanced (less common but still relevant) \u00b6 Method Description defineModule(...) Used by JPMS to define a Module for this loader. findModule(...) Looks up modules known by this loader. getUnnamedModule() Returns the \u201cdefault\u201d module (non-modular classes). registerAsParallelCapable() Declares that loader can safely load in parallel (multi-threaded). isRegisteredAsParallelCapable() Checks the above flag. 8.

Why it\u2019s useful \u00b6 A Stream is a sequence of elements supporting functional-style operations (map, filter, reduce) on collections, arrays, files, etc. It helps you write concise, readable, parallelizable code without manual loops and temporary lists. Quick glossary \u00b6 Source : Where elements come from (e.g., List , array, file). Intermediate op : Returns a new stream (lazy). Examples: filter , map , sorted . Terminal op : Triggers processing, produces a value/collection/side-effect. Examples: collect , count , forEach . Lazy : Nothing runs until a terminal operation is called. Stateless vs stateful : map is stateless; sorted / distinct are stateful (need to see more than one element). Boxed vs primitive streams : Stream<T> vs IntStream/LongStream/DoubleStream (no boxing, extra math ops). Collector : Strategy to accumulate stream results (e.g., Collectors.toList() ). Short-circuiting : Stops early (e.g., findFirst , anyMatch , limit ). Ordered : Some sources are ordered ( List ); some aren\u2019t ( HashSet ).

Gotchas / anti-patterns / version notes \u00b6 Streams are single-use : Once a terminal op runs, the stream is consumed. Create a new stream if you need to run another terminal op. Side effects in intermediate ops ( map , filter , peek ) are error-prone. Keep them pure . Use peek only for debugging/logging. parallelStream() : Only beneficial for CPU-heavy, stateless, large workloads. Avoid for small lists, IO-bound work, or when order matters. Be careful with thread-unsafe code. Ordering : HashSet.stream() has no deterministic order; operations like sorted() will impose order at a cost.

Quick glossary (beginner-friendly) \u00b6 Absolute path : a full address from the filesystem root, e.g. \"/home/alex/report.txt\" (Unix) or \"C:\\Users\\Alex\\report.txt\" (Windows). It doesn\u2019t depend on the \u201ccurrent folder\u201d. Relative path : a path relative to a base (usually the app\u2019s current working directory), e.g. \"docs/report.txt\" or \"../images/logo.png\" . Root : the topmost starting point of the filesystem ( \"/\" on Unix; a drive like \"C:\\\" on Windows). Normalize : clean a path by removing . (current dir) and resolving .. (go up one folder) without touching the disk . Resolve : join paths like URLs: base.resolve(child) \u2192 \u201cappend\u201d child to base.

Path.of(\"/home/user/docs/file.txt\") (Unix) or Path.of(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Alex\\\\file.txt\") (Windows) is absolute : it always points to the same place, no matter where the program is run. Normalize doesn\u2019t touch the disk normalize() just cleans up the string form of the path ( . and .. ). It doesn\u2019t check if the file exists. Real path touches the disk toRealPath() does check the filesystem. It resolves symlinks, checks existence, and can throw exceptions if the file isn\u2019t there. Resolve vs. Relativize confusion resolve(child) \u2192 go deeper into the tree. relativize(other) \u2192 calculate the path between two paths. You can\u2019t relativize across different drives/roots ( C:\\ vs D:\\ on Windows, or / vs a network share on Unix). StartsWith/EndsWith are by segments, not plain strings \"src/main/java/App.java\".endsWith(\"java\") \u2192 false (last segment is \"App.java\" ). \"src/main/java/App.java\".endsWith(\"App.java\") \u2192 true . Iterating excludes root /usr/local/bin will give elements \"usr\" , \"local\" , \"bin\" \u2014 the root / is not included. Cross-platform differences On Windows: roots are drives ( C:\\ ), case-insensitive by default. On Unix: root is / , case-sensitive. Bottom line \u00b6 Use Path instead of string concatenation : It handles separators, OS differences, and path logic safely. Prefer Path.of(...) (Java 11+) over Paths.get(...) .

Jump straight to \u201ctransactions\u201d or \u201csecurity\u201d without recalling which starter or module they live in. Keep pages thin. Each .md covers one concept cluster (e.g., mappings , transactions ). Avoid giant scrolls; prefer clear entry points. Cross-link ruthlessly. Example: @Transactional \u2192 links to data/queries.md @PreAuthorize \u2192 links to security/method-security.md and core-di/conditions.md Reactive-ready. WebFlux lives in its own corner but reuses MVC annotations; highlight differences, don\u2019t duplicate content. Boot awareness without dependency.

Each has different trade-offs depending on your database and performance needs . Here\u2019s the all-in-one master summary of Hibernate ID generation strategies (AUTO, SEQUENCE, IDENTITY, TABLE, UUID), including everything about batching, allocation, gaps, pros/cons, and when to use what. 1. GenerationType.AUTO \u00b6 Meaning Hibernate chooses the best strategy for the underlying database. Behavior (typical) PostgreSQL / Oracle \u2192 SEQUENCE MySQL / MariaDB / SQL Server \u2192 IDENTITY If nothing else fits \u2192 TABLE Pros Very simple, portable, no DB-specific code. Cons Hibernate\u2019s choice may change when you switch DBs \u2192 unpredictable performance. Use when Portability > performance. Good for prototypes or apps that may switch DBs. @Id @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType . AUTO ) private Long id ; 2. GenerationType.SEQUENCE \u00b6 Meaning Use a database sequence object ( nextval in PostgreSQL, seq.NEXTVAL in Oracle). How it works Hibernate fetches IDs from the sequence. Can pre-fetch blocks of IDs ( allocationSize ). IDs are known before insert , so batching works well. Pros Best performance with JDBC batching. IDs assigned in memory before flush. Efficient for high-volume inserts. Cons Requires sequence object in DB (Hibernate can create one if allowed). With pooled allocation ( allocationSize > 1 ), gaps appear. Use when On PostgreSQL/Oracle (databases with strong sequence support). High-throughput insert-heavy workloads. Example @Id @SequenceGenerator ( name = \"user_seq_gen\" , sequenceName = \"user_id_seq\" , allocationSize = 50 // prefetch 50 IDs at a time ) @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType . SEQUENCE , generator = \"user_seq_gen\" ) private Long id ; SQL (PostgreSQL) CREATE SEQUENCE user_id_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 ; 3. GenerationType.IDENTITY \u00b6 Meaning Use DB\u2019s auto-increment/identity column . The DB assigns IDs during INSERT . How it works Hibernate issues the INSERT . The DB generates the ID. Hibernate fetches it afterward. Pros Very simple. Fits MySQL / SQL Server defaults. No sequence object needed. Cons Hibernate doesn\u2019t know ID until after insert \u2192 batching is limited. Insert throughput lower than SEQUENCE. Use when On MySQL / SQL Server (legacy schemas). When simplicity matters more than insert performance. Example @Id @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType . IDENTITY ) private Long id ; DDL id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ; 4. GenerationType.TABLE \u00b6 Meaning Use a special table as a pseudo-sequence. How it works Hibernate stores current value in a table ( hibernate_sequences or custom). Reads/updates the row to generate IDs. Pros Portable to any DB , even those without sequences or identity. Cons Slowest, requires extra table reads/writes. High contention under concurrency. Use when Extreme portability is needed. Rare in modern production apps. Example @Id @TableGenerator ( name = \"user_tbl_gen\" , table = \"id_generator\" , pkColumnName = \"gen_name\" , valueColumnName = \"gen_val\" , pkColumnValue = \"user_id\" , allocationSize = 50 ) @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType . TABLE , generator = \"user_tbl_gen\" ) private Long id ; SQL CREATE TABLE id_generator ( gen_name VARCHAR ( 64 ) PRIMARY KEY , gen_val BIGINT NOT NULL ); INSERT INTO id_generator ( gen_name , gen_val ) VALUES ( 'user_id' , 1 ); 5. UUID / GUID (Hibernate-specific) \u00b6 Meaning Use UUID (128-bit identifier) instead of numeric IDs. How it works Hibernate (6+) can generate UUIDs in the app ( @UuidGenerator ). Stored as BINARY(16) (compact) or CHAR(36) (readable) in DB. Pros Globally unique \u2014 good for distributed systems. IDs generated without DB round-trip . Known before persist \u2014 useful for references/events. Cons Larger (16 bytes vs 8). Random UUIDs fragment B-trees \u2192 prefer time-ordered UUIDs (v7/ULID) . Harder to debug than numbers. Use when You need distributed ID generation across multiple services/nodes. You want IDs before hitting the DB. Microservices, offline clients, event-driven systems. Example (MySQL, compact storage) @Id @UuidGenerator @JdbcTypeCode ( SqlTypes . BINARY ) // store UUID in 16 bytes @Column ( columnDefinition = \"BINARY(16)\" ) private UUID id ; DDL CREATE TABLE users ( id BINARY ( 16 ) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , name VARCHAR ( 100 ) NOT NULL , uuid_txt CHAR ( 36 ) AS ( BIN_TO_UUID ( id )) STORED ); \u2699\ufe0f Key Cross-Cutting Concepts \u00b6 \ud83d\udd04 Batching \u00b6 JDBC batching = send multiple inserts in one round trip. Best with SEQUENCE (IDs known up front). Limited with IDENTITY (IDs only known after insert). Enable in Hibernate: hibernate.jdbc.batch_size = 50 \ud83d\udce6 Allocation / Prefetching \u00b6 With SEQUENCE and TABLE , Hibernate can fetch blocks of IDs using allocationSize . Example: allocationSize=50 \u2192 Hibernate grabs 50 IDs and consumes them gradually. Benefits: fewer DB calls, better batching. Downsides: gaps if app crashes or restarts. \u26a0\ufe0f Gaps \u00b6 All strategies may produce gaps: Rollbacks Crashes Pooled allocations Don\u2019t use IDs as business order \u2014 always add a created_at column. \u2705 When to Use What (Cheat Sheet) \u00b6 Strategy Best Fit Pros Cons AUTO Portability Easiest, automatic choice Unpredictable per DB SEQUENCE PostgreSQL / Oracle Best batching, performance, pre-fetch Needs sequence object, gaps IDENTITY MySQL / SQL Server (legacy schemas) Simple, DB-native Weak batching, slower inserts TABLE Exotic DBs, portability needed Works everywhere Slow, contention-heavy UUID Distributed / microservices / offline Global uniqueness, no DB round-trip Larger index, may fragment \ud83d\ude80 Quick Rules of Thumb \u00b6 High throughput inserts (Postgres/Oracle) \u2192 SEQUENCE + batching. MySQL/SQL Server legacy \u2192 IDENTITY . Distributed/microservices \u2192 UUID (prefer time-ordered). Extreme portability \u2192 TABLE . Don\u2019t care / just starting \u2192 AUTO . \u2705 In short: Use SEQUENCE when you can (best batching). Use IDENTITY if schema/DB requires it. Use UUID if you need IDs outside the DB or in distributed systems. Expect gaps with any method. Never use PK for business ordering \u2192 add timestamps. MySQL \u00b6 UUID Primary Keys (Compact BINARY(16) Storage) \u00b6 When using UUIDs as primary keys in MySQL, storing them as CHAR(36) strings is common but inefficient. A better approach is to store them in a compact binary format using BINARY(16) . This reduces storage space and improves index performance. Here\u2019s a tiny, end-to-end example of UUID primary keys on MySQL , stored compactly as BINARY(16) and generated in the app with Hibernate 6. 1) MySQL table (compact PK + easy-to-read helper) \u00b6 CREATE TABLE users ( id BINARY ( 16 ) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , -- packed UUID name VARCHAR ( 100 ) NOT NULL , created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP , -- Optional: human-readable mirror (handy for ad-hoc queries) uuid_txt CHAR ( 36 ) AS ( BIN_TO_UUID ( id )) STORED ) ENGINE = InnoDB ; You don\u2019t have to keep uuid_txt \u2014it\u2019s just convenient. The real PK is BINARY(16) . 2) Hibernate/JPA entity (Hibernate 6) \u00b6 import jakarta.persistence.* ; import java.time.Instant ; import java.util.UUID ; import org.hibernate.annotations.CreationTimestamp ; import org.hibernate.annotations.UuidGenerator ; import org.hibernate.annotations.JdbcTypeCode ; import org.hibernate.type.SqlTypes ; @Entity @Table ( name = \"users\" ) public class User { @Id @UuidGenerator // generates java.util.UUID in the app (no DB round-trip) @JdbcTypeCode ( SqlTypes . BINARY ) // map UUID -> BINARY(16) @Column ( name = \"id\" , columnDefinition = \"BINARY(16)\" ) private UUID id ; @Column ( nullable = false ) private String name ; @CreationTimestamp @Column ( name = \"created_at\" , nullable = false , updatable = false ) private Instant createdAt ; // getters/setters ... } If your Hibernate exposes a time-ordered style, you can do @UuidGenerator(style = UuidGenerator.Style.TIME) to reduce index fragmentation vs random v4. 3) Spring/JPA settings (example) \u00b6 spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = none # or update/create at your own risk spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size = 50 4) Using it \u00b6 User u = new User (); u . setName ( \"Alice\" ); userRepository . save ( u ); // Hibernate generates UUID in-memory and sends as 16 bytes System . out . println ( u . getId ()); // you already have the ID before insert 5) Handy SQL when querying manually \u00b6 -- Find by a textual UUID SELECT id , name , created_at FROM users WHERE id = UUID_TO_BIN ( '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000' ); -- See the UUIDs in text form (thanks to the generated column) SELECT uuid_txt , name , created_at FROM users ; Notes & options \u00b6 Why BINARY(16) ? 2\u00d7 smaller than CHAR(36) , faster indexes. Time-ordered UUIDs: Random v4 UUIDs fragment B-trees. Prefer v7 (time-ordered) if possible: Generate UUIDv7 in your code (library) and assign it to id before save() , or Use a Hibernate generator with a time-ordered style if your version supports it. MySQL\u2019s UUID_TO_BIN(..., 1) trick: When you generate IDs in SQL (not here), using UUID_TO_BIN(uuid, 1) stores bytes in a time-friendly order. If you go that route, be consistent and also read with BIN_TO_UUID(id, 1) . With Hibernate generating IDs as Java UUID , you typically stick to the straightforward mapping above (no swap flag). FAQs: UUID vs SEQUENCE vs IDENTITY \u00b6 1) When to pick UUID / GUID (Hibernate 6) \u00b6 Choose a UUID/GUID primary key when one or more of these are true: You need to generate IDs outside the DB (e.g., in services, message producers, offline/mobile clients) and later upsert/merge in the DB. You have multiple writer nodes / multi-region and want globally unique IDs without coordinating with the DB first. You want to avoid an extra DB round-trip per ID assignment (helpful when using IDENTITY , or when you don\u2019t want to call a sequence). You want stable IDs before persistence (useful for building relationships in memory, emitting events, logs, URLs, etc.). You\u2019re using an event-driven or CQRS setup and need IDs as soon as aggregates are created. Trade-offs \u00b6 Pros: globally unique across services, no DB trip to get an ID, easy replication/sharding, IDs exist before insert. Cons: bigger indexes; random UUIDs (v4) fragment B-trees and bloat indexes. Prefer time-ordered IDs (UUIDv7, v1, ULID-style) to keep inserts mostly append-only and indexes tighter. Practical mapping tips \u00b6 PostgreSQL: use uuid column type. MySQL/MariaDB: use BINARY(16) and store packed UUIDs (don\u2019t store as 36-char strings). SQL Server: UNIQUEIDENTIFIER . Oracle: RAW(16) . Hibernate 6 examples: // Postgres-friendly @Id @org.hibernate.annotations.UuidGenerator // Hibernate 6 @org.hibernate.annotations.JdbcTypeCode ( org . hibernate . type . SqlTypes . UUID ) @Column ( columnDefinition = \"uuid\" ) private java . util . UUID id ; // MySQL-friendly (packed) @Id @org.hibernate.annotations.UuidGenerator @org.hibernate.annotations.JdbcTypeCode ( org . hibernate . type . SqlTypes . BINARY ) @Column ( columnDefinition = \"BINARY(16)\" ) private java . util . UUID id ; (If your Hibernate version exposes a \u201ctime\u201d style for the generator, use it to get time-ordered UUIDs.) 2) \u201cIf we can pre-order IDs with SEQUENCE, why do we need IDENTITY? Can we pre-fetch 50 and use them one by one?\u201d \u00b6 Yes, you can pre-fetch and reuse \u00b6 With GenerationType.SEQUENCE plus @SequenceGenerator(allocationSize = 50) , Hibernate will fetch a block of 50 IDs from the DB sequence and cache them in memory . It then consumes those IDs: for batched inserts , or for individual inserts over time , until the block is exhausted , then it fetches the next block automatically. This is not limited to a single \u201cbatch operation\u201d. It\u2019s a pool that gets used as your app persists entities. Note you may see gaps (e.g., app restarts with unused IDs in the block). @Id @SequenceGenerator ( name = \"user_seq\" , sequenceName = \"user_id_seq\" , allocationSize = 50 // prefetch 50 at a time ) @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType . SEQUENCE , generator = \"user_seq\" ) private Long id ; So\u2026 why use IDENTITY at all? \u00b6 IDENTITY remains common because: Database choice / legacy: MySQL and SQL Server schemas traditionally rely on identity/auto-increment. Many shops, tools, and DBAs default to it. Simplicity: No separate sequence object to manage. One column with AUTO_INCREMENT / IDENTITY . Existing systems & tooling: ETL, ORM defaults, migration scripts, audit triggers, etc., may expect identity columns. DB feature set: Some environments don\u2019t use sequences; identity is the \u201cnative\u201d and operationally familiar option. Downside: with IDENTITY , Hibernate learns the key after each insert, which weakens true JDBC insert batching. (That\u2019s exactly why sequences or UUIDs tend to perform better for heavy write loads.) Quick chooser \u00b6 High write throughput on Postgres/Oracle: SEQUENCE + allocationSize (pooled) + JDBC batching. Multi-service / offline ID generation / pre-persistence IDs: UUID (prefer time-ordered variants). Legacy MySQL/SQL Server or simplest ops: IDENTITY is fine; accept weaker batching. Maximum portability to odd DBs: TABLE (understand it\u2019s slower). Extra tips \u00b6 Don\u2019t rely on PK order for business sorting; use created_at or a business key. Expect gaps with any strategy (rollbacks, pooling, restarts). If you use UUIDs on MySQL, store as BINARY(16) and consider time-ordered UUIDs (e.g., v7) to reduce index fragmentation.","title":"ID Generation"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/annotations/database/id-generation%20/#id-generation-in-hibernate-summary","text":"Hibernate/JPA gives you several ways to generate primary keys.

AntPathMatcher style (older config): \"{path:**}\" PathPatternParser style (modern Spring/Boot 3+): \"{*path}\" // /raw/a/b/c.txt \u2192 path = \"a/b/c.txt\" @GetMapping ( \"/raw/{*path}\" ) // If PathPatternParser is enabled (default in recent Boot) public Resource raw ( @PathVariable String path ) { /* ... */ } // Fallback if using AntPathMatcher: @GetMapping ( \"/raw/{path:**}\" ) public Resource rawLegacy ( @PathVariable ( \"path\" ) String path ) { /* ... */ } 5) Optional path variables (the right way) \u00b6 Path variables are required by default . To make a segment optional, provide two mappings and mark the parameter optional. // /users \u2192 id = null // /users/42 \u2192 id = 42 @GetMapping ({ \"/users\" , \"/users/{id}\" }) public List < UserDto > list ( @PathVariable ( required = false ) Long id ) { /* ... */ } There\u2019s no native \u201coptional segment\u201d syntax in a single pattern for MVC; use multiple paths. 6) Dots, dashes, spaces & URL decoding \u00b6 Spring decodes %20 \u2192 space, %2B \u2192 + , etc. Dots ( . ) are safe in recent Spring Boot defaults (suffix pattern matching is off by default). If you still see truncation after a dot, ensure you\u2019re using the modern PathPatternParser and not legacy suffix pattern matching. A single {var} never includes slashes . Use a catch-all to include / . 7) Validation & error handling \u00b6 If binding fails: Missing variable \u2192 MissingPathVariableException (500 if your method signature requires it but mapping doesn\u2019t define it; usually a route/config bug). Type mismatch \u2192 MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException (400). Centralize: @RestControllerAdvice class ApiErrors { @ExceptionHandler ( MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException . class ) @ResponseStatus ( HttpStatus . BAD_REQUEST ) ErrorDto badPath ( MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException ex ) { return new ErrorDto ( \"BAD_PATH\" , ex . getMessage ()); } } You can add Bean Validation to converted types if you bind to a record/POJO via @ModelAttribute (less common for pure path vars). 8) Versioning & hierarchy examples \u00b6 // Identity first, then sub-resource @GetMapping ( \"/users/{id}/addresses/{addrId}\" ) public AddressDto get ( @PathVariable long id , @PathVariable long addrId ) { /* ... */ } // API version in the path @GetMapping ( \"/v1/users/{id}\" ) public UserDto v1 ( @PathVariable long id ) { /* ... */ } 9) @PathVariable vs friends \u00b6 @PathVariable \u2014 identity in the URL: /users/{id} . @RequestParam \u2014 filters/sorting/pagination: /users?page=2&active=true . @RequestBody \u2014 JSON body for create/update. @MatrixVariable \u2014 semi-colon parameters in a path segment ( /cars;color=red;year=2025 ) when matrix vars are enabled. 10) Trailing slashes, case, and matching engine \u00b6 Trailing slash : /users/42/ vs /users/42 \u2014 by default, treated differently. Add both mappings or configure to be tolerant. Case sensitivity : paths are case-sensitive by default. Matching engine : Modern Spring MVC favors PathPatternParser (faster, more precise). It changes catch-all syntax ( {*var} ) compared to the older Ant style ( {var:**} ). Pick one and stick with it across your project. 11) Minimal idiomatic set \u00b6 // 1) Simple identity @GetMapping ( \"/items/{id}\" ) public ItemDto one ( @PathVariable long id ) { /* ... */ } // 2) Nested resource @GetMapping ( \"/shops/{shopId}/items/{itemId}\" ) public ItemDto shopItem ( @PathVariable long shopId , @PathVariable long itemId ) { /* ... */ } // 3) Regex guard @GetMapping ( \"/tickets/{num:\\\\d+}\" ) public TicketDto ticket ( @PathVariable int num ) { /* ... */ } // 4) Catch-all @GetMapping ( \"/assets/{*path}\" ) public Resource asset ( @PathVariable String path ) { /* ... */ } 12) Quick reference table \u00b6 Need Pattern Example Single segment /{id} /users/42 Rename arg @PathVariable(\"userId\") Long id /users/42 Multiple vars /{a}/{b} /a/10/b/20 Regex constraint /{id:\\\\d+} /users/123 only Catch-all (modern) /{*path} /raw/a/b/c.txt Catch-all (legacy Ant) /{path:**} /raw/a/b/c.txt Optional segment @GetMapping({\"/u\", \"/u/{id}\"}) /u or /u/7 Map of vars @PathVariable Map<String,String> /x/1/y/2 Type conversion UUID , Enum , LocalDate , custom Converter /inv/uuid Mental model \u00b6 @PathVariable is about identity baked into the URL .

Remember: @RequestParam is for simple scalars & small structs . For complex request bodies (JSON), use @RequestBody . For URL path pieces, use @PathVariable . 1) Fast patterns you\u2019ll use daily \u00b6 @GetMapping ( \"/search\" ) public List < BookDto > search ( @RequestParam String q , // required by default @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"1\" ) int page , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"20\" ) int size , @RequestParam ( required = false ) String lang // nullable wrapper ) { /* ... */ } // Multi-values: ?tag=java&tag=spring @GetMapping ( \"/articles\" ) public List < ArticleDto > byTags ( @RequestParam List < String > tag ) { /* ... */ } // Optional without defaults @GetMapping ( \"/users\" ) public List < UserDto > users ( @RequestParam Optional < String > email ) { /* ... */ } // Arbitrary parameter bag: ?a=1&b=2 @GetMapping ( \"/echo\" ) public Map < String , String > echo ( @RequestParam Map < String , String > params ) { /* ... */ } // MultiValueMap to preserve duplicates: ?k=1&k=2 @GetMapping ( \"/kv\" ) public String kv ( @RequestParam MultiValueMap < String , String > params ) { /* ... */ } 2) Required vs default vs Optional \u00b6 Required by default: @RequestParam String q \u2192 400 if missing. Make optional: @RequestParam(required = false) String q or use Optional<String> . Provide a default: @RequestParam(defaultValue = \"java\") String q Setting defaultValue implicitly makes it not required . With Optional<T> and defaultValue , you\u2019ll get Optional.of(default) . Primitive vs wrapper: prefer wrappers ( Integer , Boolean ) for optional params; primitives can\u2019t be null . 3) Name inference & renaming \u00b6 Spring infers parameter name from the Java arg name (if compiled with -parameters , which Spring Boot enables by default). To use a different query key: @GetMapping ( \"/files\" ) public List < FileDto > list ( @RequestParam ( \"dir\" ) String directory ) { /* ... */ } 4) Multi-value binding \u00b6 // ?id=1&id=2&id=3 @GetMapping ( \"/batch\" ) public List < UserDto > getBatch ( @RequestParam List < Long > id ) { /* ... */ } // Arrays also work public List < UserDto > getBatch ( @RequestParam ( \"id\" ) long [] ids ) { /* ... */ } // CSV? Not automatic. Parse yourself: @GetMapping ( \"/batch2\" ) public List < UserDto > getBatchCsv ( @RequestParam String idsCsv ) { var ids = Arrays . stream ( idsCsv . split ( \",\" )). map ( Long :: parseLong ). toList (); /* ... */ } 5) Supported sources (Spring MVC) \u00b6 Query string: /api?q=java&page=1 Form body: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Multipart fields: alongside files in multipart/form-data (see below) JSON bodies are not @RequestParam ; use @RequestBody . 6) File upload quickies \u00b6 @PostMapping ( path = \"/upload\" , consumes = MediaType . MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_VALUE ) public UploadResult upload ( @RequestParam ( \"file\" ) MultipartFile file , // single file @RequestParam ( required = false ) String note , @RequestParam ( \"tags\" ) List < String > tags // multi-values OK ) { /* ... */ } // multiple files: @RequestParam(\"files\") List<MultipartFile> files 7) Type conversion & custom formats \u00b6 Spring converts strings \u2192 target types via the ConversionService . Works out-of-the-box for: primitives, wrappers, enums, UUID, LocalDate/LocalDateTime , BigDecimal , etc. For custom types: @Component public class SlugToProductIdConverter implements Converter < String , ProductId > { public ProductId convert ( String s ) { return ProductId . of ( s . trim (). toLowerCase ()); } } Then: @GetMapping ( \"/product\" ) public ProductDto product ( @RequestParam ProductId id ) { /* ... */ } Dates: @GetMapping ( \"/events\" ) public List < EventDto > events ( @RequestParam @DateTimeFormat ( iso = DateTimeFormat . ISO . DATE ) LocalDate day ) { /* ... */ } 8) Validation \u00b6 You can validate @RequestParam arguments with @Validated on the controller and JSR-380/Bean Validation annotations: @Validated @RestController class Api { @GetMapping ( \"/offers\" ) public List < OfferDto > offers ( @RequestParam @Min ( 1 ) @Max ( 100 ) int size , @RequestParam @Pattern ( regexp = \"[a-z]{2}\" ) String lang ) { /* ... */ } } For compound inputs, bind to a small DTO via @ModelAttribute (still query/form backed) and validate that object. 9) Empty vs missing vs default (edge-cases) \u00b6 Missing param (no key) + required \u2192 400. Empty present ( ?q= ) is present with \"\" . With required=true , that\u2019s fine; with @NotBlank , it will fail validation. defaultValue triggers when missing or empty ( \"\" ), i.e., ?q= yields default. 10) Encoding & weird characters \u00b6 Browsers encode spaces as + in query/form; Spring decodes to space. %2B is literal + . If a value needs commas/semicolons, encode them. Don\u2019t rely on CSV unless you control the client. 11) @RequestParam vs the others \u00b6 @PathVariable \u2014 part of the URL structure: /users/{id} . Good for identity. @RequestParam \u2014 filters/toggles/pagination/search: /users?active=true&page=2 . @RequestBody \u2014 JSON/XML payloads for create/update. @ModelAttribute \u2014 groups many simple params into a bean (query/form), supports validation. 12) Defaults that mirror product behavior \u00b6 @GetMapping ( \"/list\" ) public PageDto list ( @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"1\" ) int page , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"20\" ) int size , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"name\" ) String sortBy , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"asc\" ) String order ) { /* ... */ } This keeps your API forgiving while still deterministic. 13) Enum handling \u00b6 enum Status { ACTIVE , SUSPENDED } @GetMapping ( \"/accounts\" ) public List < AccountDto > list ( @RequestParam Status status ) { /* ?status=ACTIVE */ } // Case-insensitive by default? No. Make a Converter or enable relaxed binding (WebDataBinder). 14) Error handling (missing/invalid params) \u00b6 Missing required \u2192 MissingServletRequestParameterException (400). Type mismatch \u2192 MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException (400). Centralize with @ControllerAdvice : @RestControllerAdvice class ApiErrors { @ExceptionHandler ({ MissingServletRequestParameterException . class , MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException . class }) @ResponseStatus ( HttpStatus . BAD_REQUEST ) public ErrorDto badRequest ( Exception ex ) { return new ErrorDto ( \"BAD_REQUEST\" , ex . getMessage ()); } } 15) Records / small DTOs with @ModelAttribute \u00b6 When a method has a POJO/record parameter without @RequestBody , Spring treats it as a model attribute backed by query/form params: record Filter ( String q , Integer page , Integer size ) {} @GetMapping ( \"/search\" ) public List < ItemDto > search ( Filter f ) { /* /search?q=java&page=2 */ } You can combine with @Validated on the type. 16) WebFlux notes (reactive) \u00b6 Everything conceptually the same, but your method returns Mono/Flux . @RequestParam usage is identical; parameters are still decoded eagerly before the handler executes. 17) Common pitfalls checklist \u00b6 Using @RequestParam for JSON \u2192 don\u2019t; use @RequestBody . Expecting CSV to auto-split \u2192 it won\u2019t; use List<T> with repeated keys, or split yourself. Forgetting defaultValue makes it required \u2192 add it or use wrappers/ Optional . Primitives for optional params \u2192 switch to wrappers. Enum case mismatches \u2192 add a Converter<String, Enum> or normalize input. Relying on empty string vs default \u2192 defaultValue fires for empty too. 18) Minimal, idiomatic examples \u00b6 // 1) Search with sane defaults @GetMapping ( \"/v1/search\" ) public List < Item > search ( @RequestParam String q , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"1\" ) int page , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"20\" ) int size ) { /* ... */ } // 2) Filters: multi-value categories @GetMapping ( \"/v1/items\" ) public List < Item > byCategory ( @RequestParam List < String > category ) { /* ... */ } // 3) Optional toggle @GetMapping ( \"/v1/users\" ) public List < User > users ( @RequestParam Optional < Boolean > active ) { /* ... */ } // 4) File + form fields @PostMapping ( value = \"/v1/avatar\" , consumes = MediaType .

It works out of the box, and you use annotations on your DTOs when the default JSON isn\u2019t what you want. jackson common annotations & patterns \u00b6 1) @JsonProperty \u2014 rename or control access \u00b6 Why : your Java field names don\u2019t match the API JSON, or you want a field to be read-only/write-only in JSON. How it affects direction Serialization (object \u2192 JSON): field appears using the name you give. Deserialization (JSON \u2192 object): field is read from that JSON name. public class UserDto { @JsonProperty ( \"user_id\" ) private Long id ; @JsonProperty ( value = \"email\" , access = JsonProperty . Access . WRITE_ONLY ) private String email ; // accepted on input but hidden in output } Input \u2192 Object { \"user_id\" : 1 , \"email\" : \"a@b.com\" } Object \u2192 Output { \"user_id\" : 1 } Handy flags (max 5) value = \"name\" \u2192 JSON field name. access = READ_ONLY \u2192 show in output only. access = WRITE_ONLY \u2192 accept on input only. required = true \u2192 fail if missing on input. defaultValue = \"...\" \u2192 used if absent on input. 2) @JsonInclude \u2014 drop noise (nulls, empties, defaults) \u00b6 Why : make responses smaller/cleaner. @JsonInclude ( JsonInclude . Include . NON_NULL ) public class ProfileDto { private String name ; private String bio ; // null \u2192 omitted } Object \u2192 Output { \"name\" : \"Lin\" } Useful modes (pick what you need) ALWAYS \u2014 include everything (default). NON_NULL \u2014 drop only null . NON_EMPTY \u2014 drop null , \"\" , [] , {} . NON_DEFAULT \u2014 drop values equal to field defaults (e.g., 0 , false , empty). NON_ABSENT \u2014 drop Optional.empty() (keeps non-empty Optionals). Per-field override : you can also put @JsonInclude(...) directly on a field. 3) @JsonIgnore / @JsonIgnoreProperties \u2014 hide or tolerate extras \u00b6 Why : hide sensitive/internal fields, or ignore unknown JSON fields so clients don\u2019t break you. @JsonIgnoreProperties ( ignoreUnknown = true ) // ignore extra JSON input public class AccountDto { private String email ; @JsonIgnore // never show in JSON private String passwordHash ; } Input with extras \u2192 Object { \"email\" : \"a@b.com\" , \"unexpected\" : 123 } Object \u2192 Output { \"email\" : \"a@b.com\" } Useful options (max 5) ignoreUnknown = true \u2014 skip unexpected input fields. value = {\"field1\",\"field2\"} \u2014 ignore these by name. allowGetters = true \u2014 still serialize (getters allowed). allowSetters = true \u2014 still deserialize (setters allowed). @JsonIgnore (field or getter) \u2014 hard hide that one property. Tip: prefer @JsonIgnore for single fields; use @JsonIgnoreProperties for class-level rules. 4) @JsonFormat \u2014 make dates predictable \u00b6 Why : you control the exact text format instead of gambling on defaults. public class EventDto { @JsonFormat ( shape = JsonFormat . Shape . STRING , pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX\" ) private ZonedDateTime startsAt ; } Object \u2192 Output { \"startsAt\" : \"2025-10-04T09:30:00+03:00\" } Useful options (max 5) shape = STRING \u2014 format as text (common for dates). shape = NUMBER \u2014 epoch millis/seconds (with @JsonFormat + config). pattern = \"...\" \u2014 custom date pattern. timezone = \"UTC\" \u2014 force a TZ (or Europe/Vilnius ). locale = \"en\" \u2014 locale for month/day names, etc. 5) @JsonAlias \u2014 accept many input names, output one \u00b6 Why : smooth migrations: multiple incoming names map to one field. public class ProductDto { @JsonProperty ( \"price\" ) // output as \"price\" @JsonAlias ({ \"cost\" , \"amount\" }) // accept these on input private BigDecimal price ; } Valid Inputs { \"price\" : 10.99 } { \"cost\" : 10.99 } { \"amount\" : 10.99 } Object \u2192 Output { \"price\" : 10.99 } 6) @JsonCreator \u2014 build immutable objects from JSON \u00b6 Why : records/immutables or no no-arg constructor? Tell Jackson which ctor/factory to use. public class PointDto { private final int x ; private final int y ; @JsonCreator ( mode = JsonCreator . Mode . PROPERTIES ) public PointDto ( @JsonProperty ( \"x\" ) int x , @JsonProperty ( \"y\" ) int y ) { this . x = x ; this . y = y ; } } Input \u2192 Object { \"x\" : 3 , \"y\" : 4 } Useful modes (max 5) Mode.PROPERTIES \u2014 match by property names (most common). Mode.DELEGATING \u2014 pass the whole input into one param (single-value wrapper). Works with static factory + @JsonCreator too. Combine with @JsonProperty(required = true) on params. Pair with @JsonValue on the other side to serialize as a single value. 7) @JsonValue \u2014 serialize as a single value (enums/value objects) \u00b6 Why : make an enum or tiny object show up as a simple string/number. public enum Role { ADMIN ( \"admin\" ), USER ( \"user\" ); private final String label ; Role ( String l ) { this . label = l ; } @JsonValue public String toJson () { return label ; } } Enum \u2192 Output \"admin\" For deserializing back , add a @JsonCreator factory that turns the string into the enum/value object. 8) Bidirectional relations \u2014 stop infinite loops \u00b6 Problem : parent \u2192 child \u2192 parent \u2192 \u2026 during serialization. Option A: \u201cmanaged/back\u201d pair public class OrderDto { @JsonManagedReference private List < OrderItemDto > items ; } public class OrderItemDto { @JsonBackReference private OrderDto order ; } Object \u2192 Output (simplified) { \"items\" : [ { /* no \"order\" back-ref here */ } ] } Option B: identity by id @JsonIdentityInfo ( generator = ObjectIdGenerators . PropertyGenerator . class , property = \"id\" ) public class CategoryDto { private Long id ; private String name ; private List < CategoryDto > children ; private CategoryDto parent ; } Object \u2192 Output { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"Root\" , \"children\" : [ { \"id\" : 2 , \"name\" : \"Child\" , \"parent\" : 1 } ], \"parent\" : null } When to choose Use A for simple parent\u2194child where you just want to drop the back link. Use B when the graph is more complex or you want references by id. 9) Polymorphism \u2014 @JsonTypeInfo + @JsonSubTypes \u00b6 Why : a field/collection holds different concrete types; you need a type hint. @JsonTypeInfo ( use = JsonTypeInfo . Id . NAME , include = JsonTypeInfo . As . PROPERTY , property = \"type\" ) @JsonSubTypes ({ @JsonSubTypes.Type ( value = CardPaymentDto . class , name = \"card\" ), @JsonSubTypes.Type ( value = BankTransferDto . class , name = \"bank\" ) }) public abstract class PaymentDto { } public class CardPaymentDto extends PaymentDto { public String cardLast4 ; } public class BankTransferDto extends PaymentDto { public String iban ; } Object \u2192 Output { \"type\" : \"card\" , \"cardLast4\" : \"4242\" } Input \u2192 Object { \"type\" : \"bank\" , \"iban\" : \"LT12 3456 7890 1234\" } Useful options for @JsonTypeInfo (max 5) use = Id.NAME \u2014 symbolic names (most common with @JsonSubTypes ). use = Id.CLASS \u2014 fully qualified class name (tightly couples API to Java). include = As.PROPERTY \u2014 add \"type\": \"...\" field (most common). include = As.EXISTING_PROPERTY \u2014 reuse an existing field as the type key. property = \"type\" \u2014 name of that discriminator field. quick \u201cwhen do i use what?\u201d map \u00b6 Names don\u2019t match? \u2192 @JsonProperty (maybe with access ). Hide or tolerate extras? \u2192 @JsonIgnore , @JsonIgnoreProperties . Too many nulls/empties? \u2192 @JsonInclude with NON_NULL / NON_EMPTY . Dates weird? \u2192 @JsonFormat (pattern + timezone). Legacy input names? \u2192 @JsonAlias . Immutable DTOs? \u2192 @JsonCreator (+ @JsonProperty params). Graph cycles? \u2192 managed/back or identity ids. Mixed subtypes? \u2192 @JsonTypeInfo + @JsonSubTypes . tiny end-to-end example (mixing a few) \u00b6 @JsonInclude ( JsonInclude . Include . NON_EMPTY ) public class UserDto { @JsonProperty ( \"id\" ) private Long id ; @JsonProperty ( \"name\" ) private String fullName ; @JsonIgnore private String internalNote ; @JsonProperty ( value = \"email\" , access = JsonProperty . Access . WRITE_ONLY ) private String email ; // input only @JsonFormat ( shape = JsonFormat . Shape . STRING , pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd\" ) private LocalDate birthday ; @JsonProperty ( \"role\" ) private Role role ; // enum with @JsonValue as shown earlier } Input { \"id\" : 10 , \"name\" : \"Sam\" , \"email\" : \"sam@ex.com\" , \"birthday\" : \"1990-05-01\" , \"role\" : \"admin\" , \"extra\" : \"ignored client junk\" } Output { \"id\" : 10 , \"name\" : \"Sam\" , \"birthday\" : \"1990-05-01\" , \"role\" : \"admin\" } jackson advanced annotations & patterns \u00b6 Jackson has many more annotations and patterns for advanced use cases. Here are some of the most useful ones, explained with examples. 1) global vs per-class: when to annotate vs configure \u00b6 Rule of thumb If it\u2019s about a DTO\u2019s contract , prefer annotations (portable, self-documenting). If it\u2019s a cross-cutting policy , prefer mapper config (Spring Boot auto-config or your ObjectMapper bean). (No snippet here because you asked to include code only where annotations appear. Below, everything is annotation-first.) 2) @JsonInclude \u2014 advanced tricks (field-level + value filters) \u00b6 Why : fine-tune which values are omitted. // class-level: drop nulls by default @JsonInclude ( JsonInclude . Include . NON_NULL ) public class ProductDto { private String name ; // field override: drop empty strings/collections too @JsonInclude ( JsonInclude . Include . NON_EMPTY ) private String description ; // drop defaults (e.g., 0, false, empty) \u2014 great for PATCH-like responses @JsonInclude ( JsonInclude . Include . NON_DEFAULT ) private int stock ; // drop Optional.empty but keep present values @JsonInclude ( JsonInclude . Include . NON_ABSENT ) private Optional < String > ean ; // contentInclude: drop nulls inside collections/maps (keeps container) @JsonInclude ( content = JsonInclude . Include . NON_NULL ) private List < String > tags ; } Object \u2192 Output { \"name\" : \"Desk\" , \"stock\" : 0 , // NOTE: kept unless default value is actually 0 at field init \"tags\" : [] // container kept; null elements dropped } Useful modes (max 5) ALWAYS , NON_NULL , NON_EMPTY , NON_DEFAULT , NON_ABSENT content = ... \u2014 apply rule to elements of collections/maps tip: NON_DEFAULT compares to the field\u2019s initialized default . If int stock = 0; , zero will be dropped; if uninitialized, zero may be kept. 3) @JsonProperty \u2014 access, required, defaults, ordering partner \u00b6 Why : total control over naming and read/write visibility. @JsonPropertyOrder ({ \"id\" , \"name\" , \"email\" }) public class UserDto { @JsonProperty ( \"id\" ) private Long id ; // write-only: accepted on input, hidden on output @JsonProperty ( value = \"email\" , access = JsonProperty . Access . WRITE_ONLY , required = true , defaultValue = \"unknown@local\" ) private String email ; // read-only: shown in output, ignored on input @JsonProperty ( value = \"name\" , access = JsonProperty . Access . READ_ONLY ) private String fullName ; } Input \u2192 Object { \"id\" : 7 , \"email\" : \"a@b.com\" , \"name\" : \"ignored on input\" } Object \u2192 Output { \"id\" : 7 , \"name\" : \"Ada Lovelace\" } Useful options (max 5) value = \"...\" (json name) access = READ_ONLY | WRITE_ONLY | READ_WRITE required = true defaultValue = \"...\" (used if missing on input) pair with @JsonPropertyOrder (stable field order) 4) @JsonSetter / @JsonDeserialize \u2014 input rules & null handling \u00b6 Why : control how JSON becomes fields. public class SettingsDto { // treat empty string as null on input @JsonSetter ( nulls = Nulls . SKIP , contentNulls = Nulls . SKIP ) private String theme ; // custom deserializer for tricky field (e.g., \"yes\"/\"no\" \u2192 boolean) @JsonDeserialize ( using = YesNoBooleanDeserializer . class ) private boolean marketingConsent ; } Input \u2192 Object { \"theme\" : \"\" , \"marketingConsent\" : \"yes\" } \u2192 theme stays null (skipped), marketingConsent becomes true . Useful options (max 5) @JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.SKIP | Nulls.SET | Nulls.FAIL) contentNulls = ... (for collection/map elements) @JsonDeserialize(using = YourDeserializer.class) @JsonDeserialize(contentUsing = ... , keyUsing = ...) (elements/keys) @JsonDeserialize(builder = ...) (for builder patterns) 5) @JsonSerialize \u2014 output shaping (single field or keys/elements) \u00b6 Why : teach Jackson how to write a field. public class ReportDto { // custom serializer: mask last 6 of IBAN @JsonSerialize ( using = MaskingSerializer . class ) private String iban ; // map with non-string keys \u2014 serialize keys in a custom way @JsonSerialize ( keyUsing = ComplexKeySerializer . class ) private Map < UUID , Integer > balancesByAccount ; } Object \u2192 Output (conceptual) { \"iban\" : \"LT****************90\" , \"balancesByAccount\" : { \"acc:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\" : 120 } } Useful options (max 5) using = ... (value serializer) keyUsing = ... (map key serializer) contentUsing = ... (collection/map element serializer) works with @JsonFormat (dates/numbers) \u2014 format first, then serialize combine with @JsonInclude to omit post-serialization empties 6) @JsonAnySetter / @JsonAnyGetter \u2014 \u201cthe rest of the fields\u201d \u00b6 Why : capture unknown/variable properties into a map and optionally emit them back. public class FlexibleDto { private Map < String , Object > other = new HashMap <> (); @JsonAnySetter public void put ( String name , Object value ) { other . put ( name , value ); } @JsonAnyGetter public Map < String , Object > getOther () { return other ; } } Input \u2192 Object { \"x\" : 1 , \"y\" : 2 , \"anythingElse\" : 3 } Object \u2192 Output { \"x\" : 1 , \"y\" : 2 , \"anythingElse\" : 3 } Useful notes (max 5) great with evolving schemas coexists with @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true) (but you usually pick one) values can be typed ( Map<String, JsonNode> or specific DTO) pair with validation after deserialization beware of over-accepting junk (log or validate) 7) @JsonUnwrapped \u2014 flatten nested objects \u00b6 Why : emit a child object\u2019s fields at the parent level (and read them back). public class OrderDto { private String id ; @JsonUnwrapped ( prefix = \"ship_\" , suffix = \"\" ) private AddressDto shipping ; } Object \u2192 Output { \"id\" : \"o1\" , \"ship_street\" : \"Baker St\" , \"ship_city\" : \"Vilnius\" } Useful options (max 5) prefix = \"...\" , suffix = \"...\" (avoid collisions) works both ways (serialize + deserialize) avoid name clashes with parent fields can nest multiple unwrapped sub-objects with careful prefixes combine with @JsonInclude on the nested type 8) @JsonNaming \u2014 automatic casing conventions \u00b6 Why : avoid sprinkling @JsonProperty everywhere for simple case mappings. @JsonNaming ( PropertyNamingStrategies .

Don\u2019t expose Entities directly \u2014 keep Entities for persistence logic only. \ud83d\udc49 Why DTOs instead of Entities for input/return? Entities = your database model (tables, persistence rules). DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) = what you expose to the outside world (API requests & responses). Why not use entities directly? \u00b6 Security \u2192 prevents exposing internal DB fields (e.g. passwords, IDs). Flexibility \u2192 API contract can evolve without breaking your DB schema. Validation \u2192 DTOs are designed for request/response shape, so they fit @Valid checks. Separation of concerns \u2192 Entities = persistence, DTOs = communication. Keeps your code cleaner. Typical pattern \u00b6 Incoming request : DTO with @Valid (only the fields you expect from client). Service layer : Map DTO \u2192 Entity, persist.

But even then: - Use @JsonIgnore for sensitive data. - Handle cycles ( @JsonManagedReference / @JsonBackReference ). - Expect refactoring later when complexity grows. \u2705 Why You Should Use DTOs \u00b6 Security: Prevent leaking internal fields (e.g., password , isAdmin , audit data). Stability: Entities evolve freely while DTOs keep a stable public API. Validation: Add @NotBlank , @Email , etc. for request validation. Flexibility: Tailor different DTOs per endpoint (don\u2019t reuse everything). Performance: Avoid lazy-loading cycles or massive entity graphs. Versioning: Create v2 DTOs without breaking clients. \ud83e\uddf1 Example: Contact Entity + DTOs \u00b6 @Entity @Table ( name = \"contacts\" ) public class Contact { @Id @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType .

Several approaches exist \u2014 pick one main strategy. 1. MapStruct (recommended for production) \u00b6 Fast, compile-time, explicit. @Mapper ( componentModel = \"spring\" ) public interface ContactMapper { @Mapping ( target = \"id\" , ignore = true ) Contact toEntity ( CreateContactRequest req ); @BeanMapping ( nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy . IGNORE ) void updateEntity ( UpdateContactRequest req , @MappingTarget Contact target ); ContactResponse toResponse ( Contact entity ); } Service example: @Service @RequiredArgsConstructor public class ContactService { private final ContactRepository repo ; private final ContactMapper mapper ; private final PasswordEncoder encoder ; public ContactResponse create ( CreateContactRequest req ) { Contact c = mapper . toEntity ( req ); c . setPassword ( encoder . encode ( req . password ())); return mapper . toResponse ( repo . save ( c )); } public ContactResponse update ( String id , UpdateContactRequest req ) { Contact c = repo . findById ( id ). orElseThrow (); mapper . updateEntity ( req , c ); if ( req . password () != null && ! req . password (). isBlank ()) { c . setPassword ( encoder . encode ( req . password ())); } return mapper . toResponse ( repo . save ( c )); } } 2. ModelMapper (fast prototyping) \u00b6 Reflection-based, minimal setup, slower. @Configuration public class ModelMapperConfig { @Bean public ModelMapper modelMapper () { ModelMapper mm = new ModelMapper (); mm . getConfiguration (). setPropertyCondition ( Conditions . isNotNull ()); return mm ; } } Usage: Contact c = modelMapper . map ( req , Contact . class ); ContactResponse dto = modelMapper . map ( entity , ContactResponse . class ); Pros: zero boilerplate. Cons: less control, easy to miss subtle mismatches. 3. Manual Mapping (small apps) \u00b6 Ultimate control, no dependencies. @Component public class ContactMapper { public Contact toEntity ( CreateContactRequest req ) { Contact c = new Contact (); c . setName ( req . name ()); c . setEmail ( req . email ()); c . setPhotoUrl ( req . photoUrl ()); c . setPassword ( req . password ()); return c ; } public void applyUpdate ( UpdateContactRequest req , Contact c ) { if ( req . name () != null ) c . setName ( req . name ()); if ( req . email () != null ) c . setEmail ( req . email ()); if ( req . photoUrl () != null ) c . setPhotoUrl ( req . photoUrl ()); if ( req . password () != null && ! req . password (). isBlank ()) { c . setPassword ( req . password ()); } } public ContactResponse toResponse ( Contact c ) { return new ContactResponse ( c . getId (), c . getName (), c . getEmail (), c . getPhotoUrl ()); } } Pros: no magic. Cons: verbose as app grows. \ud83e\udde0 Spring Data Interface Projections \u00b6 Read-only, auto-mapped \u201cDTOs\u201d generated by Spring Data. public interface ContactView { String getId (); String getName (); } public interface ContactRepository extends JpaRepository < Contact , String > { List < ContactView > findByNameContainingIgnoreCase ( String q ); } Controller: @GetMapping ( \"/contacts\" ) public List < ContactView > list ( @RequestParam String q ) { return repo . findByNameContainingIgnoreCase ( q ); } \u2705 Great for lightweight reads. \u274c Not for writes (can\u2019t persist). \ud83d\udd04 Serialization Cycles (Jackson) \u00b6 When you serialize bidirectional relationships ( User \u2194 Order ), Jackson can loop infinitely. Option 1: @JsonManagedReference / @JsonBackReference \u00b6 Breaks recursion by ignoring the \u201cback\u201d side during serialization. class User { @JsonManagedReference List < Order > orders ; } class Order { @JsonBackReference User user ; } Good for simple parent\u2192child relationships. Option 2: @JsonIdentityInfo \u00b6 Uses object IDs instead of nesting endlessly. @JsonIdentityInfo ( generator = ObjectIdGenerators . PropertyGenerator . class , property = \"id\" ) class User { Long id ; List < Order > orders ; } @JsonIdentityInfo ( generator = ObjectIdGenerators . PropertyGenerator . class , property = \"id\" ) class Order { Long id ; User user ; } Good for complex graphs or both-direction references. \u2699\ufe0f Validation: API vs DB Constraints \u00b6 Layer Validation Type Example DTO API/business validation @NotBlank , @Email , @Pattern Entity DB-level constraints @Column(nullable=false) , unique indexes Fail fast at the API layer \u2014 never let invalid input hit the database. \ud83e\uddf0 Performance & Security Tips \u00b6 Use DTOs to avoid lazy-loading traps ( LazyInitializationException ). Don\u2019t return entire entity graphs \u2014 shape responses explicitly. Always whitelist fields (DTOs) instead of blacklisting ( @JsonIgnore ). Encode passwords in the service layer , not in mappers. For large APIs, use MapStruct + record DTOs \u2014 the cleanest and fastest. \ud83d\udce6 Project Skeleton (DTO-friendly Layout) \u00b6 src/ main/java/com/example/contacts/ entity/Contact.java dto/ CreateContactRequest.java UpdateContactRequest.java ContactResponse.java mapper/ContactMapper.java repo/ContactRepository.java service/ContactService.java web/ContactController.java Optional extras: config/SecurityConfig.java for PasswordEncoder , resources/application.yml for dev DB, test/.../ContactServiceTest.java . \ud83e\udded TL;DR \u2014 When to Use What \u00b6 Context Approach Small internal app Manual mapping or ModelMapper Production API MapStruct + record DTOs Read-only queries Spring Data projections Bi-directional relationships DTOs or @JsonIdentityInfo Security-critical data Always separate DTOs In short: Use Entities for persistence.

Only talks in HTTP types and DTOs; never leaks JPA entities back to clients. app/ holds the use cases and application rules: *UseCase interfaces + CategoryService implementation. Throws domain/application exceptions . Mark methods @Transactional . domain/ is the boring, stable core: Entities and repository interfaces (ports). Keep it persistence-agnostic in spirit; Spring Data lives here fine because it\u2019s an interface. infra/ is wiring and adapters: JPA config, security, external systems (email, S3, payment, Kafka). When you add an external integration, create a subpackage per integration. resources/db/migration/ is Flyway: SQL scripts define schema truth. The entity should match the migration, not the other way around. test/ mirrors main/ : Unit tests for app/ services, slice tests for repos ( @DataJpaTest ), and integration tests for controllers. Category example (where your files go) \u00b6 web/category/dto/CreateCategoryRequest.java web/category/dto/CategoryResponse.java web/category/mapper/CategoryWebMapper.java web/category/CategoryController.java app/category/CreateCategoryUseCase.java , UpdateCategoryUseCase.java , CategoryService.java app/exception/DuplicateCategoryException.java , CategoryNotFoundException.java domain/category/Category.java , CategoryRepository.java web/error/GlobalExceptionHandler.java (translates exceptions \u2192 ProblemDetail) MapStruct: edge mappers live at the edge \u00b6 Keep mappers with the layer that owns the types : Web mappers in web/.../mapper convert Request \u2194 Command and Entity \u2194 Response . If you ever add persistence DTOs (e.g., raw projections), add a mapper in infra/mapping/ for that boundary. Optional global config: // infra/mapping/MapStructConfig.java @Configuration @MapperConfig ( componentModel = \"spring\" , unmappedTargetPolicy = ReportingPolicy . ERROR , nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy . IGNORE ) public class MapStructConfig {} Then each mapper: @Mapper(config = MapStructConfig.class) . ProblemDetail handler location \u00b6 Put GlobalExceptionHandler in web/error/ . It depends on HTTP concerns ( ProblemDetail , HttpStatus ), so it\u2019s an edge concern. Configuration split \u00b6 application.yml \u2192 defaults. application-local.yml \u2192 dev overrides (DB URL, logging). application-test.yml \u2192 tests (H2 or Testcontainers). Use Spring profiles ( local , test , prod ). Flyway starter pack \u00b6 src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql CREATE TABLE category ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE ); V2__trim_ci_unique_index.sql (optional hardening) -- Postgres example: case/trim-insensitive index CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_category_name_norm ON category ( lower ( btrim ( name ))); Testing layout (pragmatic) \u00b6 Controller IT: @SpringBootTest + MockMvc, assert Location header and JSON body.

All \u201cproduct\u201d stuff is under catalog/product* across layers. Repeatable pattern : Each slice has web/app/domain subfolders with parallel names. Muscle memory beats search. Shared core : domain/common holds value objects and base types used cross-slice, not a dumping ground. Relationships that won\u2019t tangle your brain \u00b6 Product \u2194 Category (many-to-one). StockItem ties Product + Warehouse with quantity . Order has OrderItem s (each references Product and a snapshot price). PurchaseOrder mirrors Order but with Supplier and incoming quantities. Keep aggregates small: Order owns OrderItem s; Product doesn\u2019t own StockItem rows (inventory slice does). MapStruct placement rule (unchanged) \u00b6 Web mappers live at the edge ( web/.../mapper ), converting Request \u2194 Command and Entity \u2194 Response . If you add persistence projections/specs, put those mappers in infra/mapping/ . // infra/mapping/MapStructConfig.java @Configuration @MapperConfig ( componentModel = \"spring\" , unmappedTargetPolicy = ReportingPolicy . ERROR , nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy . IGNORE ) public class MapStructConfig {} Then annotate each mapper: @Mapper(config = MapStructConfig.class) . Use-case seams (how services don\u2019t balloon) \u00b6 One service per slice is fine early: CatalogService , InventoryService , etc., implement multiple use-case interfaces . When a service grows obese, split by workflow: e.g., OrderingService vs OrderQueryService . Keep commands/inputs narrow: CreateOrderRequest includes line items; AdjustStockRequest is just product+warehouse+delta. ProblemDetail catalog (so errors stay boring) \u00b6 Keep GlobalExceptionHandler in web/error/ . Put stable type URIs in ProblemTypes like: /problems/catalog/product-not-found /problems/inventory/insufficient-stock Base URI ( problems.base ) in application.yml , read as @ConfigurationProperties so you don\u2019t hardcode strings. Flyway starter pack (one file per slice) \u00b6 V1__init_catalog.sql CREATE TABLE category ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE ); CREATE TABLE product ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , sku TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE , name TEXT NOT NULL , category_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES category ( id ) ); V2__init_inventory.sql CREATE TABLE warehouse ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , code TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE , name TEXT NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE stock_item ( product_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES product ( id ), warehouse_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES warehouse ( id ), quantity NUMERIC ( 19 , 2 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 , PRIMARY KEY ( product_id , warehouse_id ) ); CREATE TABLE stock_movement ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , product_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES product ( id ), warehouse_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES warehouse ( id ), delta NUMERIC ( 19 , 2 ) NOT NULL , reason TEXT NOT NULL , created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now () ); V3__init_sales.sql CREATE TABLE customer ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE , name TEXT NOT NULL ); CREATE TABLE \"order\" ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , customer_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES customer ( id ), status TEXT NOT NULL , created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now () ); CREATE TABLE order_item ( order_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES \"order\" ( id ), line_no INT NOT NULL , product_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES product ( id ), qty NUMERIC ( 19 , 2 ) NOT NULL , unit_price NUMERIC ( 19 , 2 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( order_id , line_no ) ); V4__init_procurement.sql CREATE TABLE supplier ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE , email TEXT ); CREATE TABLE purchase_order ( id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY , supplier_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES supplier ( id ), status TEXT NOT NULL , created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now () ); CREATE TABLE purchase_order_item ( purchase_order_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES purchase_order ( id ), line_no INT NOT NULL , product_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES product ( id ), qty NUMERIC ( 19 , 2 ) NOT NULL , unit_cost NUMERIC ( 19 , 2 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( purchase_order_id , line_no ) ); Testing layout that mirrors slices \u00b6 Controller IT per slice ( web/catalog/*IT.java ) asserting Location , JSON shape, and ProblemDetails. Service tests per slice for business rules (stock never negative, order totals). Repo slice tests ( @DataJpaTest ) for constraints ( UNIQUE , FKs) and query specs. Navigation aids so you never get lost \u00b6 Add package-info.java in each slice ( web/catalog , app/inventory , \u2026) with a one-paragraph doc of what lives there. Put a tiny README.md in each top slice folder explaining flows and key use-cases. Keep DTO names scenario-first ( AdjustStockRequest , TransferStockRequest ) rather than generic ( UpdateWarehouse ).","title":"Multi-Slice Example"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/architecture/layout/15-multi-slice-example/#multi-slice-example-for-1030-entities","text":"When your service grows beyond a handful of entities, folder salad looms.

Put @Validated on beans whose method parameters/returns you want validated (services, listeners). Use groups for Create vs Update . Keep validators pure (no repositories). Do uniqueness with service pre-check + DB unique index . Return Problem Details for consistent errors. Prefer channel-specific DTOs (HTTP vs Kafka) and map to commands for services. Minimal starter pack (drop-in) \u00b6 If you only copy three things today, copy: GlobalExceptionHandler (ProblemDetail), @Validated on services with one parameter/return example, one custom constraint (like ValidEmail or StrongPassword ). That gives you clean failures, safe inputs, and a pattern you can extend everywhere.","title":"Quick Starter"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/architecture/validation/quick-starter/#jakarta-validation-practical-cheatsheet-spring-boot-3","text":"","title":"Jakarta Validation \u2014 Practical Cheatsheet (Spring Boot 3+)"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/architecture/validation/quick-starter/#0-setup","text":"Gradle (Kotlin DSL): dependencies { implementation ( \"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web\" ) implementation ( \"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation\" ) // Hibernate Validator } Maven: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId> org.springframework.boot </groupId> <artifactId> spring-boot-starter-web </artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId> org.springframework.boot </groupId> <artifactId> spring-boot-starter-validation </artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies>","title":"0) Setup"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/architecture/validation/quick-starter/#1-core-annotations-most-used","text":"@NotNull // must not be null @NotBlank // string has non-whitespace chars @Size ( min = , max = ) // strings, collections @Email // RFC5322-ish email check @Pattern ( regexp = ) // regex @Min , @Max // long/integers @Positive , @PositiveOrZero , @Negative @Past , @PastOrPresent , @Future , @FutureOrPresent // dates @Valid // cascade validation into nested object(s)","title":"1) Core annotations (most used)"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/architecture/validation/quick-starter/#2-dtos-in-controllers","text":"import jakarta.validation.Valid ; import jakarta.validation.constraints.* ; public record CreateUserRequest ( @NotBlank @Email @Size ( max = 255 ) String email , @NotBlank @Size ( min = 3 , max = 100 ) String name , @NotBlank @Size ( min = 8 , max = 72 ) String password ) { // Optional: sanitize public CreateUserRequest { email = email == null ? null : email . trim (). toLowerCase (); name = name == null ? null : name . trim (); password = password == null ? null : password . trim (); } } @RestController @RequestMapping ( \"/users\" ) class UserController { private final UserService service ; private final UserMapper mapper ; UserController ( UserService service , UserMapper mapper ) { this . service = service ; this . mapper = mapper ; } @PostMapping public ResponseEntity < UserResponse > create ( @Valid @RequestBody CreateUserRequest req , UriComponentsBuilder uriBuilder ) { var created = service . create ( mapper . toCommand ( req )); var location = uriBuilder . path ( \"/users/{id}\" ). buildAndExpand ( created . id ()). toUri (); return ResponseEntity . created ( location ). body ( mapper . toResponse ( created )); } } Nested & collections: public record Address ( @NotBlank String street , @NotBlank String city ) {} public record OrderRequest ( @NotNull Long userId , @Valid Address shipping , // cascade @NotEmpty @Valid java . util .

Clamp size to a sane range (e.g., 1..100) to avoid DOS-by-oversized pages.

Slice<T> for infinite scroll \u00b6 No COUNT(*) \u2192 faster on large datasets. Still has hasNext() . Slice < Contact > slice = repo . findAllByActiveTrue ( PageRequest . of ( page , size )); boolean more = slice . hasNext (); Performance notes (don\u2019t learn these the hard way) \u00b6 COUNT(*) can dominate. On huge tables, Page<T> can be expensive. If you don\u2019t need totals, switch to Slice<T> . Index your sort keys. Sorting on unindexed columns = slow. Deterministic sorting. Add a tiebreaker (e.g., createdAt desc, id desc ) for stable paging. Offset pagination drifts when rows are inserted/deleted between pages. For ultra-stable feeds, consider keyset (seek) pagination later. Error handling & edge cases \u00b6 Out-of-range page numbers still return content: [] with valid meta. That\u2019s fine. Do not return 204 for an empty page; clients expect paging metadata. Validate sort properties against a whitelist if you expose user-driven sorts.

Returning List<T> with separate \u201ccount\u201d endpoint \u2014 brittle and chatty. Accepting a comma-delimited sort string and manually parsing it when Pageable already handles multi-sort. Doing DTO mapping after the transaction closes if you rely on lazy associations. Copy-paste templates \u00b6 Simple endpoint with Pageable injection @GetMapping ( \"/contacts\" ) public Page < ContactDto > list ( @PageableDefault ( size = 20 , sort = \"id\" ) Pageable pageable ) { return repo . findAll ( pageable ). map ( ContactDto :: from ); } Explicit clamped params + DTO wrapper @GetMapping ( \"/contacts\" ) public ResponseEntity < PageResponse < ContactDto >> list ( @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"0\" ) int page , @RequestParam ( defaultValue = \"20\" ) int size ) { page = Math . max ( 0 , page ); size = Math . min ( Math . max ( size , 1 ), 100 ); Page < ContactDto > p = repo . findAll ( PageRequest . of ( page , size , Sort . by ( \"id\" ). ascending ())) . map ( ContactDto :: from ); return ResponseEntity . ok ( new PageResponse <> ( p . getContent (), new PageMeta ( p . getNumber (), p . getSize (), p . getTotalElements (), p . getTotalPages (), p . isFirst (), p . isLast ()) )); } When to graduate beyond Page<T> \u00b6 Timelines / streams where order is append-only \u2192 keyset (seek) pagination .

Where It Lives \u00b6 Package: org.springframework.http Implements: HttpEntity<T> (adds HTTP status on top) Used in: Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity ; 2. Why Use It \u00b6 Use case Alternative Problem Solution with ResponseEntity You need to set custom status return object directly Always returns 200 OK ResponseEntity.status(201) You need to send headers @ResponseBody Can\u2019t customize headers .header(\"X-Custom\", \"value\") You need conditional responses void or object No fine-grained control .notFound() , .noContent() You want to return generic DTO or error JSON ResponseBody Limited flexibility ResponseEntity<?> handles both 3. Basic Forms \u00b6 @GetMapping ( \"/user/{id}\" ) public ResponseEntity < User > getUser ( @PathVariable Long id ) { Optional < User > user = repo . findById ( id ); return user . map ( ResponseEntity :: ok ) . orElseGet (() -> ResponseEntity . notFound (). build ()); } Equivalent results: Return type Effect User \u2192 200 OK (body = User, default headers) ResponseEntity<User> \u2192 200, 404, 204, etc. (custom) 4. Factory Methods (Static Builders) \u00b6 Method HTTP Status Example ok(T body) 200 OK ResponseEntity.ok(user) ok() 200 OK, no body ResponseEntity.ok().build() created(URI location) 201 Created ResponseEntity.created(uri).build() accepted() 202 Accepted ResponseEntity.accepted().build() noContent() 204 No Content ResponseEntity.noContent().build() badRequest() 400 Bad Request ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(error) status(HttpStatus) custom ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).build() notFound() 404 Not Found ResponseEntity.notFound().build() 5. Builder Pattern API \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . status ( HttpStatus . CREATED ) . header ( \"Location\" , \"/api/user/42\" ) . contentType ( MediaType . APPLICATION_JSON ) . body ( savedUser ); Chaining allows combining headers , content type , and body in one statement. Immutable \u2014 each call produces a new instance. 6. Anatomy of a ResponseEntity \u00b6 ResponseEntity<T> \u251c\u2500 HttpStatus status \u251c\u2500 HttpHeaders headers \u2514\u2500 T body It\u2019s a simple value object \u2014 no side effects or thread context. 7. Examples by Common Scenarios \u00b6 \u2705 Success (200) \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . ok ( user ); \u2795 Created (201) \u00b6 URI location = URI . create ( \"/api/users/\" + user . getId ()); return ResponseEntity . created ( location ). body ( user ); \ud83d\udeab No Content (204) \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . noContent (). build (); \u26a0\ufe0f Bad Request (400) \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . badRequest () . body ( Map . of ( \"error\" , \"Invalid input\" )); \ud83d\udd10 Forbidden (403) \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . status ( HttpStatus . FORBIDDEN ) . build (); \u274c Not Found (404) \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . notFound (). build (); \u2699\ufe0f Custom Headers \u00b6 return ResponseEntity . ok () . header ( \"X-App-Version\" , \"1.0\" ) . body ( data ); 8. Relationship with HttpEntity and RequestEntity \u00b6 Type Represents Direction Includes HttpEntity<T> Only headers + body both request/response \u2705 headers, \u2705 body RequestEntity<T> HTTP request metadata request + method + URI ResponseEntity<T> Full HTTP response response + status code All three share the same base idea: wrap HTTP metadata with body generically. 9. Working with ResponseEntity<Void> \u00b6 Use Void when you want no body : return ResponseEntity . noContent (). build (); // same as ResponseEntity<Void> 10. Headers in Depth \u00b6 Headers are stored in an immutable HttpHeaders map. return ResponseEntity . ok () . headers ( h -> { h . setCacheControl ( \"no-cache\" ); h . add ( \"X-Trace-Id\" , traceId ); }) . body ( data ); Or build manually: HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders (); headers . set ( \"X-Rate-Limit\" , \"100\" ); return new ResponseEntity <> ( data , headers , HttpStatus . OK ); 11. Error Handling \u00b6 Spring automatically serializes the body of a ResponseEntity \u2014 even for errors: return ResponseEntity . status ( HttpStatus . BAD_REQUEST ) . body ( Map . of ( \"error\" , \"Invalid data\" )); Use consistent DTOs: record ApiError ( String message , Instant timestamp ) {} return ResponseEntity . status ( 404 ) . body ( new ApiError ( \"User not found\" , Instant . now ())); 12. Content Negotiation \u00b6 Spring respects the Accept header automatically: ResponseEntity.ok().body(user) \u2192 returns JSON or XML depending on the Accept type. contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) overrides it explicitly. 13. Using in Reactive Stack (WebFlux) \u00b6 Same class, different behavior \u2014 it\u2019s non-blocking : @GetMapping ( \"/reactive\" ) public Mono < ResponseEntity < User >> reactive () { return userService . findAsync () . map ( ResponseEntity :: ok ) . defaultIfEmpty ( ResponseEntity . notFound (). build ()); } The ResponseEntity is wrapped in a Mono , not returned directly. 14. Integration with Exception Handling \u00b6 When thrown from controllers, custom exceptions can produce ResponseEntity responses via: @ControllerAdvice public class ApiExceptionHandler { @ExceptionHandler ( UserNotFoundException . class ) public ResponseEntity < ApiError > handleUserNotFound ( UserNotFoundException ex ) { return ResponseEntity . status ( HttpStatus . NOT_FOUND ) . body ( new ApiError ( ex . getMessage (), Instant . now ())); } } 15. Testing with MockMvc \u00b6 mockMvc . perform ( get ( \"/user/42\" )) . andExpect ( status (). isOk ()) . andExpect ( jsonPath ( \"$.id\" ). value ( 42 )); Or unit test directly: ResponseEntity < User > res = controller . getUser ( 42L ); assertEquals ( HttpStatus . OK , res . getStatusCode ()); assertNotNull ( res . getBody ()); 16. Generics Power \u00b6 ResponseEntity < List < User >> resp = ResponseEntity . ok ( users ); List < User > body = resp . getBody (); Spring handles serialization for the list automatically. 17. Typical Usage Pattern \u00b6 @GetMapping ( \"/api/items\" ) public ResponseEntity < List < Item >> getAll () { List < Item > items = service . findAll (); if ( items . isEmpty ()) return ResponseEntity . noContent (). build (); return ResponseEntity . ok ( items ); } Concise, readable, fully controlled. 18. Immutable Design \u00b6 Once built, a ResponseEntity can\u2019t be modified. Each chained method produces a new instance . This makes it thread-safe and predictable inside Spring\u2019s dispatching. 19. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Mistake Problem Fix Returning null instead of ResponseEntity 500 Internal Server Error Use .noContent() or .notFound() Forgetting .build() after header/status chain Compilation error Always end chain with .build() or .body() Using wrong generic (e.g. ResponseEntity<Object> ) Type confusion, serialization warnings Use concrete type or <?> Adding headers after .build() Immutable \u2014 no effect Add before .build() Mixing reactive and MVC types Mono<ResponseEntity> vs ResponseEntity Match controller type (WebFlux vs MVC) 20. Quick Reference Summary \u00b6 Action Code OK (200) ResponseEntity.ok(body) Created (201) ResponseEntity.created(uri).body(body) Accepted (202) ResponseEntity.accepted().build() No Content (204) ResponseEntity.noContent().build() Bad Request (400) ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(error) Unauthorized (401) ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED).build() Forbidden (403) ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN).build() Not Found (404) ResponseEntity.notFound().build() Custom Status ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.I_AM_A_TEAPOT) Add Header .header(\"X-Foo\", \"bar\") Set Content Type .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) 21. Mind Model Summary \u00b6 Controller method \u2193 returns ResponseEntity<T> \u2193 [Status] \u2192 HttpStatus [Headers] \u2192 HttpHeaders [Body] \u2192 T (auto-serialized) Spring converts it into a real HTTP response at the framework boundary. 22. Conceptual Links \u00b6 Related Concept Role HttpEntity<T> Base class without status RequestEntity<T> HTTP request counterpart HttpStatus Enum for standard codes HttpHeaders Collection of header values @ResponseBody Annotation for direct serialization ResponseBodyAdvice Interceptor for modifying responses globally 23. Real-World Pattern \u00b6 Spring REST APIs often structure controller responses as: return ResponseEntity . status ( HttpStatus . CREATED ) . body ( Map . of ( \"id\" , savedId , \"timestamp\" , Instant . now ())); Framework glue (e.g. @RestController ) serializes it to JSON \u2192 sets status/headers \u2192 writes to network. 24. Bonus \u2014 Declarative vs Imperative Style \u00b6 Declarative: @GetMapping ( \"/user/{id}\" ) @ResponseStatus ( HttpStatus . CREATED ) public User createUser (...) { ... } Imperative (using ResponseEntity): @GetMapping ( \"/user/{id}\" ) public ResponseEntity < User > createUser (...) { return ResponseEntity . status ( HttpStatus . CREATED ). body ( user ); } Declarative is simpler. Imperative ( ResponseEntity ) gives precision and dynamic control. 25.

Builder \u2013 Fluent object you add parts to (path, query, fragment) to produce a URL. UriComponents \u2013 Immutable representation of a URI (scheme/host/port/path/query). Forwarded headers \u2013 Proxy headers ( X-Forwarded-* ) telling the app the external URL. Encode \u2013 Percent-encode unsafe characters (once\u2014and only once). Core package & location \u00b6 Class: org.springframework.web.servlet.support.ServletUriComponentsBuilder Module: spring-webmvc Also see: org.springframework.web.util.UriComponentsBuilder Typical use: building the Location header (201 Created) \u00b6 @PostMapping ( \"/contacts\" ) public ResponseEntity < ContactDto > create ( @RequestBody CreateContact cmd ) { Contact saved = service . create ( cmd ); URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequest () // e.g., http://localhost:8080/contacts . path ( \"/{id}\" ) // \u2192 http://.../contacts/{id} . buildAndExpand ( saved . getId ()) . toUri (); // encodes safely return ResponseEntity . created ( location ). body ( ContactDto . from ( saved )); } This produces a fully qualified URI , correctly encoded and respecting forwarded headers when configured. Common factory methods \u00b6 Factory method Base When to use fromCurrentRequest() Full current request URI (with query) For related links within the same endpoint fromCurrentRequestUri() Current URI, but without query params When adding new query params fromCurrentContextPath() Context root only ( scheme://host:port/context ) For top-level links like /health or /login fromRequest(request) Explicit HttpServletRequest When the request object is available UriComponentsBuilder.fromPath(\"/path\") No servlet dependency For tests or offline link building Examples \u2014 creating URLs \u00b6 From current request or context \u00b6 String a = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentContextPath () // https://example.com/myapp . path ( \"/files/123.png\" ) . toUriString (); String b = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri () // https://example.com/myapp/api/users/42 . replacePath ( \"/health\" ) // path becomes /health . replaceQuery ( null ) // drop query . toUriString (); Output: https://example.com/myapp/files/123.png https://example.com/myapp/health From explicit HttpServletRequest \u00b6 String url = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromRequest ( request ) . replacePath ( \"/docs\" ) . replaceQuery ( \"v=1\" ) . toUriString (); // \u2192 https://example.com/myapp/docs?v=1 Building relative or templated URIs \u00b6 String url = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentContextPath () . path ( \"/api\" ) . pathSegment ( \"users\" , \"{id}\" ) // safe segment joining + encoding . queryParam ( \"verbose\" , \"{v}\" ) // adds ?verbose=1 . buildAndExpand ( 42 , 1 ) // expand placeholders . toUriString (); // \u2192 https://example.com/myapp/api/users/42?verbose=1 Advanced transformations \u00b6 String url = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri () . replacePath ( \"/search\" ) . replaceQueryParam ( \"q\" , \"caf\u00e9\" ) // encoded to caf%C3%A9 . fragment ( \"top\" ) . toUriString (); Output: https://example.com/myapp/search?q=caf%C3%A9#top Reading URI components \u00b6 var comps = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri () . build (); System . out . println ( comps . getScheme ()); // https System . out . println ( comps . getHost ()); // example.com System . out . println ( comps . getPort ()); // -1 (default) System . out . println ( comps . getPath ()); // /myapp/api/users/42 System . out . println ( comps . getQuery ()); // active=true Adding or replacing query parameters \u00b6 URI uri = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri () . queryParam ( \"page\" , 2 ) . queryParam ( \"size\" , 20 ) . queryParam ( \"sort\" , \"name,asc\" ) . build () . toUri (); Output conversions \u00b6 UriComponents comps = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri (). build (); URI uri = comps . toUri (); // java.net.URI String asString = comps . toUriString (); // String Practical utilities \u00b6 Pagination links (RFC\u20115988 style): UriComponentsBuilder base = ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri (); String first = base . replaceQueryParam ( \"page\" , 0 ). toUriString (); String next = base . replaceQueryParam ( \"page\" , page + 1 ). toUriString (); String prev = base . replaceQueryParam ( \"page\" , Math . max ( page - 1 , 0 )). toUriString (); return ResponseEntity . ok () . header ( \"Link\" , \"<\" + first + \">; rel=\\\"first\\\", \" + \"<\" + next + \">; rel=\\\"next\\\", \" + \"<\" + prev + \">; rel=\\\"prev\\\"\" ) . body ( body ); Self link assembler: public static URI selfForId ( Object id ) { return ServletUriComponentsBuilder . fromCurrentRequestUri () . path ( \"/{id}\" ) . buildAndExpand ( id ) . toUri (); } Encoding behavior \u00b6 Path and query parts are encoded automatically . Never manually URLEncoder.encode before passing. URI.create() does not encode and will throw for illegal chars. Always rely on pathSegment() or buildAndExpand() . Proxy / deployment awareness \u00b6 Behind reverse proxies (e.g. Nginx, Traefik): Enable forwarded header support: @Bean ForwardedHeaderFilter forwardedHeaderFilter () { return new ForwardedHeaderFilter (); } Or in application.properties : server.forward-headers-strategy = framework Otherwise, you\u2019ll see internal addresses like http://localhost:8080 in generated links. Gotchas & anti-patterns \u00b6 Placeholders aren\u2019t magic: must call buildAndExpand(...) . Double slashes: avoid path(\"/a/\").path(\"/b\") \u2014 use pathSegment() . Off-request usage: fromCurrent*() requires a servlet request context. Null query values: queryParam(\"x\", (Object)null) produces ?x ; use replaceQueryParam() to remove. Double encoding: don\u2019t call .encode() twice.

Layer 1 \u2014 Reflection Layer \u00b6 Goal: Teach Spring how to see your code. Spring begins at the lowest level of Java introspection: the Reflection API . It loads your classes, inspects annotations, creates instances, and injects dependencies. Core Mechanisms Description Class<?> Java\u2019s runtime type representation Reflection API Read annotations, fields, constructors, methods @Autowired Dependency injection using reflection ClassLoader Loads .class files into Metaspace Mental model: Reflection is the microscope \u2014 Spring examines your code, understands it, and prepares to animate it. \u2192 See: reflection-layer.md \ud83c\udf3f 3. Layer 2 \u2014 Beans Layer \u00b6 Goal: Give your classes life . Spring transforms static class definitions into managed, stateful objects called Beans . Each bean is born from a BeanDefinition , which describes its type, scope, dependencies, and lifecycle methods. Core Concepts Description @Component , @Service , @Repository Mark beans for auto-detection @Bean Define explicit beans in config @PostConstruct , @PreDestroy Lifecycle callbacks BeanDefinition Metadata blueprint for each bean Scopes Singleton, prototype, request, etc. Mental model: Beans are the organs \u2014 alive within the Spring organism, created, wired, and disposed of predictably. \u2192 See: beans-layer.md \u2699\ufe0f 4. Layer 3 \u2014 Container Layer \u00b6 Goal: Coordinate and manage all living beans. At this stage, Spring evolves from a builder into a container \u2014 a runtime environment that performs Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) . Core Components Role BeanFactory The raw IoC engine that instantiates and wires beans ApplicationContext The enhanced container: adds lifecycle events, resource loading, profiles Dependency Injection Automatic connection of beans by type/name Profiles & Environment Context configuration and selection Lifecycle Events Signals like ContextRefreshedEvent and ContextClosedEvent Mental model: The Container is the brain \u2014 it knows every bean, how they depend on each other, and when to awaken or retire them. \u2192 See: container-layer.md \ud83e\udde0 5. Layer 4 \u2014 AOP Layer \u00b6 Goal: Add intelligence \u2014 the ability to intercept and extend behavior. AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) lets Spring weave extra logic into existing methods without modifying code. It creates proxies that wrap your beans and inject crosscutting concerns like transactions, caching, and logging. Core Elements Description @Aspect Marks a class containing crosscutting logic @Before , @After , @Around Advice that runs around methods execution(...) Pointcut expressions targeting specific methods Proxies JDK or CGLIB-based runtime wrappers Built-in Aspects @Transactional , @Async , @Cacheable , @PreAuthorize Mental model: AOP is the nervous system \u2014 it controls reflexes, adds patterns of behavior, and keeps your core logic pure. \u2192 See: aop-layer.md \ud83d\udce1 6. Layer 5 \u2014 Events Layer \u00b6 Goal: Enable communication \u2014 make Spring aware of its own changes. Spring\u2019s event system allows components to broadcast and listen for signals. It uses the Observer pattern to loosely couple actions across the app. Core Concepts Description ApplicationEvent Base event class @EventListener Declarative event listener ApplicationEventPublisher Publishes events to the container Built-in Events ContextRefreshedEvent , ApplicationReadyEvent , etc. Async Events @Async + @EnableAsync for background handling Mental model: Events are the heartbeat \u2014 they keep the container alive, synchronized, and reactive to its own lifecycle. \u2192 See: events-layer.md \ud83e\uddec 7. Full System Flow \u2014 From Class to Context \u00b6 1. JVM loads classes into Metaspace. 2. Reflection scans annotations and builds BeanDefinitions. 3. IoC container creates beans and injects dependencies. 4. Post-processors modify or proxy beans (AOP). 5. Context publishes lifecycle events. 6. Beans operate in a managed runtime ecosystem. 7. On shutdown \u2192 destroy methods + ContextClosedEvent. \ud83e\uddf1 8.

Think of each bean as a citizen of Spring\u2019s managed world \u2014 born, connected, and retired by the container. \ud83e\udde9 2. Declaring Beans \u00b6 You can register beans in three main ways: \ud83e\uddf1 Component Scanning (Annotation-based) \u00b6 @Component public class PaymentService {} Spring scans packages for these stereotypes: Annotation Role @Component Generic Spring-managed bean @Service Service-layer bean (semantic marker) @Repository Persistence-layer bean (adds exception translation) @Controller Web MVC component @Configuration Source of explicit bean definitions \u2699\ufe0f Explicit Bean Registration (Configuration Class) \u00b6 @Configuration public class AppConfig { @Bean public AuditService auditService () { return new AuditService (); } } Each @Bean method returns an object that Spring registers as a managed bean. \ud83e\uddee XML Configuration (Legacy) \u00b6 <bean id= \"paymentService\" class= \"com.app.PaymentService\" /> Old style, still supported but rarely used in modern applications. \ud83e\uddec 3. BeanDefinition \u2014 The Blueprint Metadata \u00b6 When Spring detects a bean, it doesn\u2019t create it immediately. It first builds a BeanDefinition \u2014 a metadata record describing: Property Meaning beanClass Actual Class<?> scope singleton , prototype , etc. autowireMode How dependencies are injected initMethodName Custom initialization method destroyMethodName Cleanup method lazyInit Whether bean is created on demand dependsOn Other beans that must be created first Example (simplified pseudocode): BeanDefinition bd = new BeanDefinition (); bd . setBeanClass ( PaymentService . class ); bd . setScope ( \"singleton\" ); bd . setInitMethodName ( \"init\" ); bd . setDestroyMethodName ( \"cleanup\" ); This blueprint is what the BeanFactory later uses to actually create the instance. \u2699\ufe0f 4. Bean Scopes \u2014 Controlling Lifespan \u00b6 Scope Meaning Created Destroyed singleton One instance per container On context start On context close prototype New instance per request On demand Not tracked request One per HTTP request On web request start On web request end session One per HTTP session On session start On session end application One per ServletContext On context init On shutdown @Component @Scope ( \"prototype\" ) public class Task {} \ud83e\udde0 5. Bean Lifecycle Stages \u00b6 1. Definition created (BeanDefinition) 2. Instance constructed (reflection) 3. Dependencies injected (@Autowired, @Value) 4. Lifecycle callbacks triggered (@PostConstruct, init-method) 5. Bean enters ready state 6. On context shutdown \u2192 @PreDestroy or destroy-method called Lifecycle Annotations and Interfaces \u00b6 Type Example Purpose Annotation @PostConstruct After injection Annotation @PreDestroy Before destruction Interface InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet() Post-injection initialization Interface DisposableBean.destroy() Cleanup XML Attr init-method / destroy-method Legacy equivalent Example \u00b6 @Component public class ConnectionPool { @PostConstruct public void init () { System . out . println ( \"Pool ready\" ); } @PreDestroy public void shutdown () { System . out . println ( \"Pool closed\" ); } } Output: Pool ready ... Pool closed \ud83e\udde9 6. Dependency Injection Timing \u00b6 Spring always injects dependencies before calling any init methods. That\u2019s why you can safely rely on @Autowired fields or constructor-injected dependencies inside your @PostConstruct . instantiate \u2192 inject \u2192 initialize \u2192 active \u2192 destroy \ud83e\uddee 7. Lazy and Conditional Beans \u00b6 Lazy \u00b6 @Component @Lazy public class ExpensiveBean {} Created only when first requested. Conditional \u00b6 @Bean @ConditionalOnProperty ( \"feature.x.enabled\" ) public FeatureX feature () { return new FeatureX (); } Used heavily in Spring Boot auto-configuration. \ud83e\udded 8. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Symptom Cause Fix BeanCurrentlyInCreationException Circular dependency Break cycle or use @Lazy NullPointerException on injected field Bean not scanned Fix @ComponentScan path NoSuchBeanDefinitionException No bean found Annotate or register bean Init/destroy not called Wrong signature Must be public void no-arg method Prototype beans not destroyed Expected behavior Manage manually if needed \u2699\ufe0f 9. Inspecting Beans at Runtime \u00b6 @Autowired ApplicationContext ctx ; public void debugBeans () { for ( String name : ctx . getBeanDefinitionNames ()) { System . out . println ( name + \" \u2192 \" + ctx . getType ( name )); } } \ud83e\udde9 10. Custom BeanPostProcessor \u00b6 Advanced hook that modifies beans before/after initialization. @Component public class LoggerInjector implements BeanPostProcessor { public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization ( Object bean , String name ) { // before @PostConstruct return bean ; } public Object postProcessAfterInitialization ( Object bean , String name ) { // after @PostConstruct return bean ; } } Used internally for: Autowiring processor AOP proxy creation Validation, caching, and more \ud83e\udded 11.

Concept Overview \u00b6 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes what things are. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) organizes what they do repeatedly across many places. Without AOP: public void transfer () { startTransaction (); try { doTransfer (); commit (); } catch ( Exception e ) { rollback (); } } With AOP: @Transactional public void transfer () { doTransfer (); } Spring inserts the transaction logic around your method automatically. \ud83e\ude9e 2. What Is an Aspect? \u00b6 An Aspect is a class that holds crosscutting logic \u2014 code that applies to multiple classes or methods. Core AOP Terms \u00b6 Term Meaning Example Aspect Class containing advice @Aspect class LoggingAspect { ... } Advice The actual code that runs before/after a method @Before , @After , @Around Pointcut Rule that selects which methods get intercepted execution(* com.app..*(..)) Join Point A specific point in method execution where advice can run Method call, exception Proxy Wrapper that intercepts and forwards method calls Generated by Spring \ud83e\udde0 3. How AOP Works in Spring \u00b6 Your Bean (target) \u2193 Spring detects AOP annotations \u2193 Creates Proxy Bean (wrapper) \u2193 Proxy intercepts method call \u2193 Applies advice (before/after/around) \u2193 Calls target method Spring uses reflection and dynamic proxies to wrap your bean at runtime \u2014 you never call the real object directly. \u2699\ufe0f 4. Declaring Aspects \u00b6 Enable AOP in a configuration class: @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy public class AppConfig {} Define an Aspect: @Aspect @Component public class LoggingAspect { @Before ( \"execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))\" ) public void logBefore ( JoinPoint jp ) { System . out . println ( \"Method start: \" + jp . getSignature ()); } @After ( \"execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))\" ) public void logAfter ( JoinPoint jp ) { System . out . println ( \"Method end: \" + jp . getSignature ()); } } \ud83e\udde9 5. Types of Advice \u00b6 Advice Type Annotation When It Runs Example Before @Before Before method call Logging, auth checks After @After After method (success or fail) Cleanup AfterReturning @AfterReturning Only after success Metrics, caching AfterThrowing @AfterThrowing On exception Error handling Around @Around Wraps the method call Transactions, timing Example \u2014 Around Advice \u00b6 @Aspect @Component public class TimingAspect { @Around ( \"execution(* com.app..*(..))\" ) public Object measure ( ProceedingJoinPoint jp ) throws Throwable { long start = System . nanoTime (); Object result = jp . proceed (); System . out . println ( jp . getSignature () + \" took \" + ( System . nanoTime () - start ) + \"ns\" ); return result ; } } \u2699\ufe0f 6. Pointcut Expressions \u00b6 The execution() designator defines where advice applies. execution ( modifiers - pattern ? return - type - pattern declaring - type - pattern ? method - name - pattern ( param - pattern ) throws - pattern ? ) Examples: execution ( * com . app . service . * . * (..)) // all methods in package execution ( public * * (..)) // all public methods execution ( * transfer (..)) // any method named transfer execution ( * com . app .. * ( String )) // any method with String arg Combine rules: @Before ( \"execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..)) && @annotation(Transactional)\" ) \ud83e\uddec 7. Proxy Types \u2014 How Spring Intercepts Calls \u00b6 Spring AOP uses runtime proxies , not compile-time weaving. Proxy Type Mechanism Applies To Library JDK Dynamic Proxy Implements interfaces Interface-based beans java.lang.reflect.Proxy CGLIB Proxy Subclasses the target class Concrete classes (no interfaces) Bytecode generation via CGLIB Spring decides automatically: If the bean implements an interface \u2192 JDK proxy Otherwise \u2192 CGLIB subclass \ud83d\udd0d JDK Proxy Example \u00b6 MyService proxy = ( MyService ) Proxy . newProxyInstance ( clazz . getClassLoader (), new Class [] { MyService . class }, ( p , method , args ) -> { System . out . println ( \"Before call\" ); return method . invoke ( target , args ); }); \ud83d\udd2c CGLIB Example \u00b6 Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer (); enhancer . setSuperclass ( MyService . class ); enhancer . setCallback (( MethodInterceptor ) ( obj , method , args , proxy ) -> { System . out . println ( \"Before \" + method . getName ()); return proxy . invokeSuper ( obj , args ); }); MyService proxy = ( MyService ) enhancer . create (); \ud83e\uddf1 8. Built-In AOP Features in Spring \u00b6 Feature Annotation Underlying Mechanism Transactions @Transactional TransactionInterceptor via AOP Asynchronous execution @Async AsyncExecutionInterceptor Caching @Cacheable , @CachePut , @CacheEvict CacheInterceptor Security @PreAuthorize , @Secured MethodSecurityInterceptor Retries @Retryable RetryOperationsInterceptor All of these are implemented as aspects . \ud83e\udde9 9. AOP + IoC Integration Flow \u00b6 1. Context starts 2. Spring scans beans 3. Detects @Aspect classes 4. Builds proxies for target beans 5. Replaces original bean references with proxy 6. Proxies intercept method calls 7. Calls proceed() \u2192 executes target logic From that moment, every call goes through the proxy pipeline. \u26a1 10. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Problem Cause Fix Advice not applied Self-invocation (method calls inside same class) Move method to another bean or use AspectJ compile-time weaving AOP disabled Missing @EnableAspectJAutoProxy Add in config No proxy created Final class/method Remove final or use interface @Transactional not working Calling private/self method Ensure proxy boundary Order issues Multiple aspects Use @Order annotation \ud83e\udde0 11. Debugging Proxies \u00b6 Check whether a bean is proxied: System . out . println ( AopUtils . isAopProxy ( bean )); // true/false System . out . println ( AopUtils . getTargetClass ( bean )); Print proxy class: System . out . println ( bean . getClass ()); // usually com.sun.proxy.$ProxyXX or CGLIB$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB \ud83e\uddee 12. Custom Aspect Example \u2014 Audit Logging \u00b6 @Aspect @Component public class AuditAspect { @Around ( \"@annotation(Audit)\" ) public Object audit ( ProceedingJoinPoint jp ) throws Throwable { System . out . println ( \"AUDIT \u2192 \" + jp . getSignature ()); return jp . proceed (); } } And annotation: @Target ( ElementType . METHOD ) @Retention ( RetentionPolicy . RUNTIME ) public @interface Audit {} Now @Audit can be added to any method, and the aspect intercepts it. \ud83e\udde9 13. Performance Notes \u00b6 Proxy creation happens once at startup ; not during runtime. Method interception adds minimal overhead (microseconds). Avoid deep proxy chains (e.g., multiple AOP frameworks stacked). Avoid applying AOP to ultra-hot code paths (like millions of calls/sec). \ud83e\udded 14.

It turns Spring into an event-driven ecosystem rather than a silent dependency injector. \ud83e\udded 1. Concept Overview \u00b6 Spring\u2019s event system is built on the Observer Pattern : one part of the app publishes an event , and many others can listen to it asynchronously (or synchronously) \u2014 without knowing about each other. [Publisher] \u2192 [ApplicationEventMulticaster] \u2192 [Listeners] This enables loose coupling between parts of the application \u2014 components don\u2019t talk directly, they communicate through events. \u2699\ufe0f 2. The Core Interfaces \u00b6 Interface Role Typical Implementation ApplicationEvent Base type for events Custom or built-in ApplicationEventPublisher Used to publish events ApplicationContext implements it ApplicationListener<E> Interface for event listeners Your listener classes ApplicationEventMulticaster Internal dispatcher Sends events to listeners Typical Interaction \u00b6 @Component public class OrderPublisher { @Autowired ApplicationEventPublisher publisher ; public void createOrder ( Order order ) { // business logic ... publisher . publishEvent ( new OrderCreatedEvent ( this , order )); } } @Component public class OrderListener implements ApplicationListener < OrderCreatedEvent > { public void onApplicationEvent ( OrderCreatedEvent event ) { System . out . println ( \"Order received \u2192 \" + event . getOrder (). getId ()); } } \ud83e\udde9 3. Built-in Spring Events \u00b6 Spring emits many lifecycle events as the container starts and stops: Event When It\u2019s Published ContextRefreshedEvent After all beans are created & initialized ContextStartedEvent When context is explicitly started ContextStoppedEvent When context is stopped (not closed) ContextClosedEvent When context is shutting down ApplicationReadyEvent When Boot app is fully ready ApplicationFailedEvent On startup error WebServerInitializedEvent When embedded server starts (Spring Boot) Common Boot Example \u00b6 @Component public class StartupLogger { @EventListener ( ApplicationReadyEvent . class ) public void appReady () { System . out . println ( \"\u2705 Application is up and running!\" ); } } \ud83e\udde0 4. Writing Custom Events \u00b6 Create your own ApplicationEvent subclass: public class UserRegisteredEvent extends ApplicationEvent { private final User user ; public UserRegisteredEvent ( Object source , User user ) { super ( source ); this . user = user ; } public User getUser () { return user ; } } Publish it: publisher . publishEvent ( new UserRegisteredEvent ( this , newUser )); Listen for it: @Component public class WelcomeEmailListener { @EventListener public void onUserRegistered ( UserRegisteredEvent e ) { System . out . println ( \"Sending welcome email to \" + e . getUser (). getEmail ()); } } \u2699\ufe0f 5. Simplified Internal Flow \u00b6 Your code \u2192 publisher.publishEvent(event) \u2193 ApplicationEventMulticaster finds all listeners \u2193 Each listener receives onApplicationEvent(event) Spring Boot replaces the default multicaster with a SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster , which can run listeners asynchronously if configured. \ud83d\udd01 6. Asynchronous Event Handling \u00b6 You can make listeners run in background threads: @EnableAsync @Component public class AsyncListener { @Async @EventListener public void handleEvent ( UserRegisteredEvent e ) { System . out . println ( \"Handling event asynchronously for \" + e . getUser (). getEmail ()); } } You can also register a custom TaskExecutor for more control. \ud83e\udde9 7. Event Ordering and Filtering \u00b6 Listener Order \u00b6 @EventListener @Order ( 1 ) public void beforeEvent (...) { ... } @EventListener @Order ( 2 ) public void afterEvent (...) { ... } Conditional Listening \u00b6 @EventListener ( condition = \"#event.user.premium == true\" ) public void handlePremium ( UserRegisteredEvent event ) { System . out . println ( \"Premium user signup detected!\" ); } This uses Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to filter events. \ud83e\uddee 8. Programmatic Registration \u00b6 Sometimes listeners are registered manually, especially in frameworks. ctx . addApplicationListener (( ApplicationEvent event ) -> { if ( event instanceof ContextRefreshedEvent ) System . out . println ( \"Context refreshed!\" ); }); \ud83e\uddf1 9. Event Publishing in Boot Lifecycle \u00b6 Spring Boot itself uses the event system for application phases : ApplicationStartingEvent \u2193 ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent \u2193 ApplicationPreparedEvent \u2193 ApplicationStartedEvent \u2193 ApplicationReadyEvent \u2193 ApplicationFailedEvent (if any errors) You can listen to these via ApplicationListener or @EventListener \u2014 useful for startup diagnostics or pre-initialization hooks. \ud83e\udde9 10. Advanced: Custom Multicaster \u00b6 You can override the multicaster bean to change event dispatching behavior. @Bean ( name = \"applicationEventMulticaster\" ) public ApplicationEventMulticaster asyncMulticaster () { SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster m = new SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster (); m . setTaskExecutor ( new SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor ()); return m ; } This makes all events asynchronous by default. \u26a1 11. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Problem Cause Fix Listener not firing Bean not registered in context Annotate with @Component Event missed Published before listener initialized Use SmartApplicationListener or reorder Async listener not async Missing @EnableAsync Enable async in config Wrong event type Mismatched generic in ApplicationListener Match exact class or use wildcard Context events duplicated Multiple contexts in Boot Use ApplicationContextAware to filter \ud83e\udde9 12.

It is not part of Spring or DBeaver \u2014 it\u2019s its own project. It\u2019s lightweight, fast, embeddable , and can run: In-memory \u2192 everything stored in RAM, disappears when you stop your app. File-based \u2192 saves data in a .mv.db file on disk. TCP server \u2192 runs like a mini DB server that tools (like DBeaver) can connect to. Think of H2 as a mini MySQL/Postgres but simpler, great for learning, demos, or development. \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f What is DBeaver? \u00b6 DBeaver is a GUI tool \u2014 it is not a database itself. It lets you connect to databases (H2, MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, etc.), browse tables, run SQL, and manage data . DBeaver sometimes shows an \u201cexample DB\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s just a demo H2 database included so you can click around. \ud83d\udd27 How to use H2 + DBeaver (step by step) \u00b6 1. Install DBeaver \u00b6 On Fedora (or most Linux): flatpak install flathub io.dbeaver.DBeaverCommunity Run it: flatpak run io.dbeaver.DBeaverCommunity 2. Get H2 \u00b6 Download from: https://www.h2database.com \u2192 h2-*.jar . This JAR contains the database engine. Run H2 as a TCP server : java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -tcpPort 9092 -ifNotExists -tcp \u2192 start in server mode -tcpPort 9092 \u2192 listens on port 9092 -tcpAllowOthers \u2192 lets other apps (like DBeaver) connect -ifNotExists \u2192 creates DB if it doesn\u2019t exist This keeps H2 running like a small DB server on your machine. 3. Connect DBeaver to H2 \u00b6 Open DBeaver \u2192 New Connection \u2192 choose H2 . Select Server mode (since we started TCP). Fill in: Host: localhost Port: 9092 Database: ~/testdb (H2 will create testdb.mv.db in your home folder) User: sa Password: (leave empty unless you set one) Now you can open SQL editor in DBeaver and start working with H2. 4. Try some SQL \u00b6 In DBeaver SQL editor: -- Create a table CREATE TABLE users ( id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR ( 100 ) ); -- Insert rows INSERT INTO users ( name ) VALUES ( 'Alice' ), ( 'Bob' ); -- Query rows SELECT * FROM users ; You\u2019ll see the results in DBeaver\u2019s result grid. \ud83d\udd0d Important concepts \u00b6 H2 is the database engine (like a lightweight MySQL). DBeaver is just the UI client that connects to it. TCP server mode lets external apps (like DBeaver) connect. File DB \u2192 persists data in .mv.db file. In-memory DB \u2192 temporary, vanishes when stopped. \u2705 When to use \u00b6 Learning SQL without installing MySQL/Postgres. Quick development or testing. Exploring databases with a GUI (DBeaver). \u26a0\ufe0f Not recommended for production \u2014 for real apps use MySQL, Postgres, etc. \ud83c\udf31 What is Spring Boot? \u00b6 Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easy to build applications. It gives you: Auto-configuration (sensible defaults). Embedded servers (no need to deploy to Tomcat manually). Starters (dependencies for common features). For databases, it integrates smoothly with H2 . \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f What is H2 in Spring Boot? \u00b6 H2 is just a database engine. Spring Boot can detect H2 on the classpath and automatically connect to it. You can run your app with: In-memory DB \u2192 fast, temporary. File DB \u2192 persists data to disk. TCP server \u2192 allows external tools like DBeaver to connect. \ud83d\udd27 How to set up \u00b6 1. Create Spring Boot project \u00b6 Use Spring Initializr or CLI: spring init --dependencies = web,data-jpa,h2 demo cd demo Dependencies: spring-boot-starter-web \u2192 REST API / web endpoints. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa \u2192 JPA/Hibernate for database. com.h2database:h2 \u2192 the H2 DB engine. 2. Add an Entity \u00b6 In src/main/java/.../User.java : import jakarta.persistence.* ; @Entity public class User { @Id @GeneratedValue ( strategy = GenerationType . IDENTITY ) private Long id ; private String name ; // getters & setters } This defines a table user with columns id and name . 3. Create a Repository \u00b6 In UserRepository.java : import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository ; public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository < User , Long > {} Spring Data JPA generates CRUD methods (save, findAll, delete, etc.) automatically. 4. Configure H2 \u00b6 In src/main/resources/application.properties : In-memory DB (disappears when app stops) \u00b6 spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;MODE=MySQL spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.h2.Driver spring.datasource.username = sa spring.datasource.password = spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update spring.h2.console.enabled = true spring.h2.console.path = /h2-console Visit: http://localhost:8080/h2-console File DB (persists to disk, easier with DBeaver) \u00b6 spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:file:./data/devdb;MODE=MySQL;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.h2.Driver spring.datasource.username = sa spring.datasource.password = spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update spring.h2.console.enabled = true 5. Create a REST Controller \u00b6 In UserController.java : import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.* ; import java.util.List ; @RestController @RequestMapping ( \"/users\" ) public class UserController { private final UserRepository repo ; public UserController ( UserRepository repo ) { this . repo = repo ; } @GetMapping public List < User > getAll () { return repo . findAll (); } @PostMapping public User add ( @RequestBody User user ) { return repo . save ( user ); } } 6. Run the app \u00b6 ./mvnw spring-boot:run or ./gradlew bootRun Test it: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\":\"Alice\"}' curl http://localhost:8080/users \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Inspect in DBeaver \u00b6 If you used file mode with AUTO_SERVER=TRUE : Start your app (it creates ./data/devdb.mv.db ). In DBeaver \u2192 New Connection \u2192 H2 \u2192 Server mode. Host: localhost , Port: 9092 (if TCP server), or point to file ( ./data/devdb ). User: sa , Password: (blank) . You\u2019ll see the USER table and the rows created from your REST API calls. \u2705 Concepts Recap \u00b6 Entity = Java class \u2192 DB table. Repository = Interface \u2192 auto CRUD methods. Datasource URL = defines how Spring talks to DB (in-memory, file, or server). H2 Console = web UI at /h2-console for quick inspection. DBeaver = external UI if you want richer DB exploration. \u26a0\ufe0f For Production \u00b6 Replace H2 with real DB (MySQL/Postgres). Change dependency to the right JDBC driver. Change spring.datasource.url , username, password. Keep entity + repository code the same. \u2705 With this setup, you can build a Spring Boot app, test it against H2, and explore data with DBeaver \u2014 all without installing a heavy database server.","title":"H2 setup"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/data/h2/#h2-database-with-dbeaver-and-spring-boot-full-setup-guide","text":"","title":"\ud83d\ude80 H2 Database with DBeaver and Spring Boot \u2014 Full Setup Guide"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/data/h2/#what-is-h2","text":"H2 is a database engine written in Java.

Add MySQL driver \u00b6 Maven (pom.xml): <dependency> <groupId> com.mysql </groupId> <artifactId> mysql-connector-j </artifactId> </dependency> Gradle (build.gradle): implementation 'com.mysql:mysql-connector-j' 2. Configure datasource \u00b6 src/main/resources/application.properties spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/appdb spring.datasource.username = appuser spring.datasource.password = apppass spring.datasource.driver-class-name = com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver # Choose ONE ddl-auto option (see below) spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update # Tells Hibernate which SQL dialect to use so it can generate the correct SQL syntax # (MySQL 8 has features and keywords not in older versions, so use MySQL8Dialect). spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect spring.jpa.show-sql = true # optional, for debugging Alternative (YAML): spring : datasource : url : jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/appdb username : appuser password : apppass driver-class-name : com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver jpa : hibernate : ddl-auto : update # or validate/create-drop show-sql : true properties : hibernate : dialect : org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect 3. Schema management options \u00b6 Spring Boot can handle schema in several ways. Pick one strategy : A) JPA auto-DDL (fast dev) \u00b6 spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update update \u2192 tries to evolve schema without dropping data (dev-friendly). create-drop \u2192 creates fresh schema on start, drops on shutdown (tests only). create \u2192 drop + create on each startup. validate \u2192 just checks schema matches entities; fails if not. B) SQL scripts (deterministic, app-driven) \u00b6 Put files in src/main/resources/ : schema.sql \u2192 runs first data.sql \u2192 runs after schema Example schema.sql : CREATE TABLE users ( id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , email VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL UNIQUE ); Example data.sql : INSERT INTO users ( email ) VALUES ( 'admin@example.com' ); Enable init: spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = none spring.sql.init.mode = always C) Database migrations (best for real projects) \u00b6 Use Flyway or Liquibase for versioned migrations. Flyway example (recommended): spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = none spring.flyway.enabled = true spring.flyway.locations = classpath:db/migration Place migrations in: src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__add_orders.sql 4. Using DB users \u00b6 Use appuser/apppass (created by Docker setup) in application.properties . Don\u2019t use root for apps; keep root only for DB admin. If you add new users (e.g., reporter ), just switch the credentials. 5. Testing the connection \u00b6 Run docker compose ps \u2192 MySQL container must show as running. In Spring Boot logs you should see: HHH000400: Using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect ... HikariPool-1 - Start completed. * Try a simple JPA repository or JDBC query to confirm. \u2705 With this config: Spring Boot talks to the MySQL container via localhost:3306 . You can decide whether JPA builds schema, you run SQL scripts, or Flyway manages migrations. Everything stays local, consistent, and reproducible. Spring Boot \u00d7 MySQL schema strategy cheatsheet \u00b6 TL;DR recommendation \u00b6 Dev (local): JPA update or Flyway Test (integration): create-drop (throwaway DB) or Flyway clean+migrate Prod: Flyway/Liquibase (versioned migrations). Avoid auto-DDL. Option A \u2014 JPA auto-DDL \u00b6 What: Hibernate creates/changes tables from your entities. Use when Fast local prototyping. Early-stage projects. Pros Zero SQL to write. Very quick iteration. Cons Not deterministic across environments. Risky in prod (unexpected alters/drops, subtle diffs). Key settings # application-dev.properties spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update # dev-friendly spring.jpa.show-sql = true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect # application-test.properties spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create-drop # ephemeral DB for tests # application-prod.properties spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = validate # guardrails only Guardrails Never use create / create-drop in prod. Switch to validate before deploying. Option B \u2014 Spring SQL scripts ( schema.sql , data.sql ) \u00b6 What: Spring runs schema.sql then data.sql at startup. Use when You want deterministic startup without a migration tool. Simple apps or demos. Pros Clear order: schema \u2192 data. Easy to reason about. Cons No versioning/history out of the box. Harder to evolve schema over time. Key settings # disable Hibernate DDL; let SQL files run spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = none spring.sql.init.mode = always # or \"embedded\" (defaults for H2) spring.sql.init.encoding = UTF-8 File layout src/main/resources/schema.sql src/main/resources/data.sql Tip Make inserts idempotent when possible ( ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ) so app restarts don\u2019t explode. Option C \u2014 Migrations (Flyway / Liquibase) \u2705 \u00b6 What: Versioned, incremental SQL (or YAML/XML) migrations, applied automatically. Use when Teamwork, CI/CD, multiple environments. Long-lived apps with auditable schema changes. Pros Deterministic & repeatable across envs. Easy rollback strategies (by version). Plays great with CI/CD. Cons Slightly more setup. Requires discipline (one migration per change). Flyway example spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = none spring.flyway.enabled = true spring.flyway.locations = classpath:db/migration # Optional but handy: # spring.flyway.clean-disabled=true # protect prod # spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true # adopt existing DBs src/main/resources/db/migration/ \u251c\u2500 V1__init.sql \u251c\u2500 V2__add_orders.sql \u2514\u2500 V3__seed_lookup_data.sql Liquibase (alt) spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = none spring.liquibase.change-log = classpath:db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml Which to pick by environment \u00b6 Environment Recommended Why Dev (local) JPA update or Flyway Speed vs. discipline.

Prod-like testing \u2192 Multi-stage Dockerfile ensures runtime is identical to deploy image. 2. Core setup \u00b6 Dev Compose ( docker-compose.dev.yml ) \u00b6 Runs Spring app via maven:temurin image. Mounts your project source ( .:/workspace:Z ) \u2192 hot reload with Spring DevTools. Exposes: 8080 \u2192 app HTTP port 5005 \u2192 JVM remote debug Uses named Maven repo volume to cache dependencies without polluting host. Remote Debugging \u00b6 The app JVM runs inside container. IntelliJ attaches over localhost:5005 . This is the standard way to debug any \u201cremote\u201d JVM (container, VM, Kubernetes, etc.). 3. Keeping host clean \u00b6 Source code : mounted into container with :Z (SELinux relabel). Dependencies : Maven repo isolated in named volume ( maven-repo ). Configs/env : use environment: in Compose or .env files \u2192 no leaking into host. User IDs : run container with user: \"${UID}:${GID}\" to avoid root-owned files on host.

Why use Podman for dev? \u00b6 Native on Fedora \u2192 runs rootless, integrates with SELinux. Clean host \u2192 no global JDK/Maven installs, no clutter in ~/.m2 . Same as prod \u2192 your app runs inside the same Java/Maven image you\u2019ll use for deployment. Reproducible \u2192 Dockerfile + Compose = self-documenting environment. Fast feedback \u2192 bind mounts + Spring DevTools = hot reload. Debug-friendly \u2192 remote JVM debug works seamlessly. 2. Key building blocks \u00b6 Dev container ( docker-compose.dev.yml ) \u00b6 Runs app using maven + JDK image . Mounts your project source so changes are seen instantly. Caches Maven dependencies in a named volume . Exposes 8080 (HTTP) and 5005 (debug) . Example: services : dev : image : maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21 working_dir : /workspace command : mvn spring-boot:run ports : - \"8080:8080\" - \"5005:5005\" environment : - MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1g - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005 volumes : - .:/workspace:Z - maven-repo:/root/.m2:Z volumes : maven-repo : Production-like image ( Dockerfile ) \u00b6 Multi-stage build: compile in Maven image \u2192 run in slim JRE image. App runs as non-root user . Example: FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build WORKDIR /app COPY pom.xml . RUN mvn -B -q -DskipTests dependency:go-offline COPY src ./src RUN mvn -B -DskipTests package FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre WORKDIR /app COPY --from = build /app/target/*.jar app.jar RUN useradd --no-create-home spring && chown spring:spring /app/app.jar USER spring EXPOSE 8080 ENTRYPOINT [ \"java\" , \"-jar\" , \"/app/app.jar\" ] 3. Development workflow \u00b6 Start dev container podman compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up 2. Open project in IntelliJ IDEA (Community is fine). 3. Attach debugger : * Run \u2192 Edit Configurations \u2192 Remote JVM Debug. * Host `localhost`, Port `5005`. * Breakpoints will hit. Edit code locally \u2192 DevTools reloads in container \u2192 refresh browser. Stop/reset : podman compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down Add --volumes if you want a totally fresh environment. 4. Keeping host clean & consistent \u00b6 Bind mount code : .:/workspace:Z \u2192 edit on host, run in container. Named volume for Maven repo : keeps dependencies out of host home. Environment-as-code : use .env or environment: in Compose. User mapping : run with your UID/GID to avoid root-owned files: user : \"${UID}:${GID}\" and export: export UID = $( id -u ) GID = $( id -g ) 5. Extras \u00b6 Database (e.g., Postgres) \u2192 add as service in Compose: db : image : postgres:16 environment : POSTGRES_DB : appdb POSTGRES_USER : app POSTGRES_PASSWORD : secret volumes : - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data:Z * Profiles \u2192 use SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local|dev|prod . * Secrets \u2192 in .env for dev, Podman/K8s secrets for production. * Automation \u2192 wrap commands in Makefile for easy make run/test/clean . 6. Fedora / Podman specifics \u00b6 SELinux : always add :Z to bind mounts. Rootless : ports \u22651024 (8080/5005) work fine. Debug : remote JVM debug is the normal way. File change detection : if reload is flaky, bump inotify: echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf sudo sysctl -p * Container shell (when needed): podman compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec dev sh \u2705 Final Takeaway \u00b6 Using Podman for Spring Boot development gives you: Reproducibility \u2192 same environment as teammates & prod. Isolation \u2192 no clutter on host, easy reset with one command. Fast inner loop \u2192 local edits reload instantly in container. Debug power \u2192 attach IntelliJ via remote JVM debug. Flexibility \u2192 databases, profiles, secrets all defined in Compose. Fedora-native \u2192 SELinux-friendly, rootless, lightweight. \ud83d\udc49 The combination of docker-compose.dev.yml (for hot reload + debug) and a multi-stage Dockerfile (for prod-like builds) is the golden setup for containerized Spring Boot development on Fedora with Podman.","title":"Development in Containers"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/setup/development-in-containers/#spring-boot-development-in-containers-podman-on-fedora","text":"","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Spring Boot Development in Containers (Podman on Fedora)"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/setup/development-in-containers/#1-why-develop-inside-containers","text":"Reproducible & clean \u2192 Same JDK, Maven, OS libs as prod.

Spring Boot Binding \u2014 The Foundation \u00b6 Spring Boot automatically maps config values to fields. @Value \u00b6 For one-off keys: @Value ( \"${paths.entries.uploads:data/uploads}\" ) private String uploadsDir ; @ConfigurationProperties \u00b6 For structured configs: @ConfigurationProperties ( prefix = \"paths\" ) public record PathsProps ( String home , Map < String , String > entries ) {} Environment variable mapping: PATHS_ENTRIES_UPLOADS \u2192 paths.entries.uploads . 4.

What is the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)? \u00b6 It\u2019s a set of conventions that says where things should live on a Linux system. Why? So that all apps, tools, and sysadmins know where to look for stuff \u2014 no surprises. Example: Logs usually live in /var/log/... \u2192 so logrotate , journalctl , monitoring tools, etc. can find them. Configs go in /etc/... \u2192 so sysadmins know where to tweak settings. Binaries in /usr/bin , /opt/... \u2192 so they don\u2019t clutter random places. Think of it like: a tidy house where the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom are always in the same place. 2. How does this apply to any app? \u00b6 Yes \u2014 this is the standard for all Linux apps . Apache, Nginx, MySQL, Postgres\u2026 they all follow this structure. If you build your app this way, sysadmins treat it just like those apps. It\u2019s not \u201cmandatory\u201d (your app still runs if you just java -jar myapp.jar from your home folder), but following FHS makes it more professional and maintainable . 3. How does this relate to a Spring Boot app ? \u00b6 Spring Boot gives you a \u201cfat jar\u201d (executable JAR) that can run anywhere with java -jar . That\u2019s great for development, but in production you don\u2019t want everything in one random folder. Instead: Executable JAR Put it in /opt/myapp/myapp.jar \u2192 /opt is where \u201cadd-on software\u201d lives (things not part of the base system). Configs ( application.yml , .env ) Put in /etc/myapp/ \u2192 This way, when you redeploy a new JAR version, your configs survive. Logs Go to /var/log/myapp/ \u2192 Or you let systemd handle logs (view with journalctl -u myapp ). Persistent data (uploads, caches, DB files if embedded) Put in /var/lib/myapp/ \u2192 That\u2019s the \u201cstateful data\u201d place. Service management Create a systemd service file ( /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service ) so you can do: sudo systemctl start myapp sudo systemctl enable myapp sudo systemctl status myapp \u2192 This makes it behave like any system service. Reverse proxy / TLS If you use Nginx, config goes in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ (with a symlink into sites-enabled/ ). Log rotation If you write logs to files, put a config in /etc/logrotate.d/myapp \u2192 so old logs get rotated, compressed, and deleted automatically. 4. Beginner-friendly analogy \u00b6 Imagine your Spring Boot JAR is a toy robot \ud83e\uddbe: By default, you just dump it on your desk (your dev machine) and it runs. Following FHS is like putting it into a toolbox with labeled drawers in a workshop: /opt/myapp/ \u2192 where the robot itself lives. /etc/myapp/ \u2192 where you keep the robot\u2019s instructions (configs). /var/log/myapp/ \u2192 where you store the robot\u2019s diary (logs). /var/lib/myapp/ \u2192 where the robot stores its memory (persistent data). systemd \u2192 the workshop switch to turn the robot on/off. nginx \u2192 the receptionist who speaks to visitors and forwards requests to your robot. This way, any mechanic (sysadmin) walking in knows exactly where to look \u2014 they don\u2019t need to guess. Step-by-step guide to deploy a Spring Boot JAR the \u201cLinux-native\u201d way \u00b6 0) Assumptions \u00b6 App name: myapp JAR file you built: target/myapp-1.0.0.jar App listens on port 8080 (default Spring Boot) You can change names/ports\u2014just keep paths consistent. 1) Create a dedicated user and folders \u00b6 # 1) Least-privilege system user (no login shell) sudo useradd --system --home /opt/myapp --shell /usr/sbin/nologin myapp # 2) FHS directories sudo mkdir -p /opt/myapp sudo mkdir -p /etc/myapp sudo mkdir -p /var/log/myapp sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/myapp # 3) Permissions (only myapp can read/write its stuff) sudo chown -R myapp:myapp /opt/myapp /var/log/myapp /var/lib/myapp sudo chown root:root /etc/myapp sudo chmod 750 /opt/myapp /var/log/myapp /var/lib/myapp sudo chmod 750 /etc/myapp 2) Install the JAR \u00b6 # Copy your built jar into /opt/myapp and standardize the name sudo cp target/myapp-1.0.0.jar /opt/myapp/myapp.jar sudo chown myapp:myapp /opt/myapp/myapp.jar sudo chmod 640 /opt/myapp/myapp.jar Tip: for upgrades, replace myapp.jar atomically (see \u201cUpgrades\u201d below). 3) Externalize configuration \u00b6 3.1 /etc/myapp/application.yml \u00b6 server : port : 8080 spring : profiles : active : prod # If you want file logging (optional, see Section 6) # logging: # file: # name: /var/log/myapp/app.log sudo nano /etc/myapp/application.yml sudo chown root:root /etc/myapp/application.yml sudo chmod 640 /etc/myapp/application.yml 3.2 /etc/myapp/myapp.env (environment variables) \u00b6 # Example secrets and tuning (do NOT commit this to git) JAVA_OPTS = \"-Xms256m -Xmx512m\" SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL = \"jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/mydb\" SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME = \"myuser\" SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD = \"supersecret\" # If you use a random secret: # SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_...=... sudo nano /etc/myapp/myapp.env sudo chown root:root /etc/myapp/myapp.env sudo chmod 640 /etc/myapp/myapp.env Spring Boot will read env vars automatically ( SPRING_* ). We\u2019ll also pass --spring.config.additional-location so it loads /etc/myapp/application.yml . 4) Create a systemd service \u00b6 /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service : [Unit] Description = MyApp Spring Boot Service After = network.target [Service] User = myapp Group = myapp WorkingDirectory = /opt/myapp EnvironmentFile = /etc/myapp/myapp.env # Load external config from /etc plus allow env vars to override ExecStart = /usr/bin/java $JAVA_OPTS \\ -jar /opt/myapp/myapp.jar \\ --spring.config.additional-location=file:/etc/myapp/application.yml # Restart rules Restart = always RestartSec = 5 # Security hardening (safe defaults; relax if needed) NoNewPrivileges = true PrivateTmp = true ProtectSystem = full ProtectHome = true ReadWritePaths = /var/log/myapp /var/lib/myapp # If you use port <1024, you'll need capabilities or a reverse proxy # Logging to journald (journalctl -u myapp) StandardOutput = journal StandardError = journal [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Enable + start: sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable myapp sudo systemctl start myapp sudo systemctl status myapp # View logs journalctl -u myapp -f 5) (Optional) Put Nginx in front (reverse proxy + TLS) \u00b6 /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf : server { listen 80 ; server_name example.com ; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080 ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; proxy_read_timeout 60s ; } } Enable and test: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myapp.conf sudo nginx -t sudo systemctl reload nginx TLS (recommended): use certbot/Let\u2019s Encrypt to upgrade the server block to listen 443 ssl with real certs. 6) Choose your logging strategy \u00b6 A) Use journald only (simplest) \u00b6 Already configured in the service. Tail logs: journalctl -u myapp -f No logrotate needed (journald handles rotation). B) Write to files in /var/log/myapp/ (if you must) \u00b6 Enable file logging (uncomment in application.yml or use env vars): logging : file : name : /var/log/myapp/app.log Logrotate config /etc/logrotate.d/myapp : /var/log/myapp/*.log { daily rotate 14 compress missingok notifempty copytruncate } Permissions: sudo chown myapp:myapp /var/log/myapp sudo chmod 750 /var/log/myapp 7) App data (persistent state) \u00b6 Put any uploads/caches/db files under: /var/lib/myapp/ Make sure your app points there (via config/env). The systemd unit allows write access to this path. 8) Health check & firewall \u00b6 # If your app exposes /actuator/health curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/actuator/health # Optional firewall (UFW example\u2014only expose 80/443 if using Nginx) sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw allow 443 # Keep 8080 internal only (don\u2019t allow from the internet) 9) Upgrades (zero-ish downtime) \u00b6 # 1) Copy new jar alongside (atomic swap) sudo cp target/myapp-1.1.0.jar /opt/myapp/myapp.jar.new sudo chown myapp:myapp /opt/myapp/myapp.jar.new sudo chmod 640 /opt/myapp/myapp.jar.new # 2) Swap sudo mv /opt/myapp/myapp.jar.new /opt/myapp/myapp.jar # 3) Restart service sudo systemctl restart myapp sudo systemctl status myapp Configs in /etc/myapp and data in /var/lib/myapp remain untouched. 10) Uninstall (clean removal) \u00b6 sudo systemctl stop myapp sudo systemctl disable myapp sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service sudo systemctl daemon-reload # Optional: remove files (careful: data/logs!) # sudo rm -rf /opt/myapp /etc/myapp /var/lib/myapp /var/log/myapp # sudo userdel myapp Quick mental model (recap) \u00b6 /opt/myapp \u2192 the program (jar) /etc/myapp \u2192 settings/secrets /var/log/myapp \u2192 logs /var/lib/myapp \u2192 data systemd \u2192 start/stop/restart & autostart nginx \u2192 public entry + TLS","title":"Spring Boot JAR the \u201cLinux-native\u201d way"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/setup/spring-app-as-linux-native/#deploy-a-spring-boot-jar-the-linux-native-way-using-fhs-systemd-optional-nginx","text":"","title":"Deploy a Spring Boot JAR the \u201cLinux-native\u201d way using FHS + systemd + optional Nginx."},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/java/spring/setup/spring-app-as-linux-native/#1-what-is-the-fhs-filesystem-hierarchy-standard","text":"It\u2019s a set of conventions that says where things should live on a Linux system.

That\u2019s great for development, but in production you don\u2019t want everything in one random folder. Instead: Executable JAR Put it in /opt/myapp/myapp.jar \u2192 /opt is where \u201cadd-on software\u201d lives (things not part of the base system). Configs ( application.yml , .env ) Put in /etc/myapp/ \u2192 This way, when you redeploy a new JAR version, your configs survive. Logs Go to /var/log/myapp/ \u2192 Or you let systemd handle logs (view with journalctl -u myapp ). Persistent data (uploads, caches, DB files if embedded) Put in /var/lib/myapp/ \u2192 That\u2019s the \u201cstateful data\u201d place. Service management Create a systemd service file ( /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service ) so you can do: sudo systemctl start myapp sudo systemctl enable myapp sudo systemctl status myapp \u2192 This makes it behave like any system service. Reverse proxy / TLS If you use Nginx, config goes in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ (with a symlink into sites-enabled/ ).

It\u2019s a self-contained Python environment that lives inside your project folder. Think of it as a sandbox where you can install Python packages without messing up your system or other projects. Each venv : Has its own Python interpreter (copied from your system\u2019s). Has its own site-packages folder (where libraries get installed). Ignores all global packages unless told otherwise. \ud83c\udfaf Why Use It \u00b6 Without venv , if you install libraries like this: pip install mkdocs they go into your global Python \u2014 polluting everything. Soon you\u2019ll have version conflicts and dependency chaos between projects. With venv : Every project has isolated dependencies . You can safely use different library versions per project. You can delete or recreate it anytime \u2014 your system stays clean. \u2699\ufe0f How To Create and Use \u00b6 1. Create a venv python3 -m venv .venv This makes a folder .venv with a fresh Python setup inside. 2. Activate it System Command Linux / macOS source .venv/bin/activate Windows (cmd) .venv\\Scripts\\activate Windows (PowerShell) .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1 When active, your shell prompt changes \u2014 usually you\u2019ll see (.venv) in front. 3. Install libraries pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-obsidian They\u2019ll install inside .venv only , not globally. 4. Freeze (optional) If you want to share exact versions with others: pip freeze > requirements.txt Then anyone can recreate your setup with: pip install -r requirements.txt 5. Deactivate deactivate \ud83e\uddf9 In .gitignore \u00b6 You always exclude .venv/ : .venv/ Because it\u2019s bulky, system-specific, and can be recreated from requirements.txt . \ud83e\udde0 Quick Summary Table \u00b6 Task Command Notes Create python3 -m venv .venv Makes environment in .venv/ Activate source .venv/bin/activate Start using it Deactivate deactivate Return to system Python Install packages pip install <package> Only affects this project List packages pip list Shows installed inside venv Export dependencies pip freeze > requirements.txt For version tracking Reinstall from file pip install -r requirements.txt Recreates setup \ud83e\udde9 Mental Model \u00b6 Imagine your computer is a city. Each Python project is its own apartment . venv gives each apartment: Its own kitchen (libraries) Its own utilities (interpreter) But shares the city\u2019s infrastructure (OS-level Python) So if one apartment burns its kitchen down (dependency conflict), the others stay safe. \u26a0\ufe0f venv Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls \u00b6 \ud83e\udde9 1. \u201cI installed a package, but Python says \u2018ModuleNotFoundError\u2019\u201d \u00b6 Cause: You forgot to activate your virtual environment. Fix: Activate it before installing or running: source .venv/bin/activate You\u2019ll know it\u2019s active when you see (.venv) before your prompt. \ud83d\udc0d 2. \u201cI have multiple Python versions \u2014 which one is used?\u201d \u00b6 Each venv is tied to the Python version that created it. Example: python3.11 -m venv .venv means your venv uses Python 3.11 , even if your system later upgrades to 3.12. If you remove or change your system Python, that venv might break. Tip: Always note your Python version in your README. \ud83d\udc80 3. \u201cThe venv folder got corrupted or too big\u201d \u00b6 Don\u2019t panic \u2014 just delete .venv/ and recreate it: rm -rf .venv python3 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt That\u2019s it. Your clean sandbox returns, good as new. \ud83e\udde0 4. \u201cMkDocs (or some tool) not found even though I installed it\u201d \u00b6 That means the tool was installed inside the venv, but your shell isn\u2019t using that path. Fix: activate the venv before running: source .venv/bin/activate mkdocs serve or run it explicitly from inside: .venv/bin/mkdocs serve \ud83d\udcbc 5. \u201cDo I need to commit .venv to Git?\u201d \u00b6 Never. Just commit your requirements.txt . .venv is like your temporary workbench \u2014 everyone can rebuild it from the list of dependencies. \u2699\ufe0f 6. \u201cCan I have more than one venv?\u201d \u00b6 Absolutely. You can have one per project, or even multiple inside one project for different experiments: .venv/ .venv-py311/ .venv-py312/ Just activate whichever one you need. \ud83d\udd04 7. \u201cI closed the terminal \u2014 do I have to activate again?\u201d \u00b6 Yes. The activation is per shell session. Once you close it, your environment resets, and you\u2019ll need to: source .venv/bin/activate again when reopening your project. \ud83e\udde0 Quick Diagnosis Checklist \u00b6 If something isn\u2019t working: Is your prompt showing (.venv) ? \u2192 If not, activate it. Does which python or where python show .venv/bin/python ? \u2192 If not, wrong environment. Did you reinstall dependencies after deleting .venv ? \u2192 Run pip install -r requirements.txt . \ud83d\udca1 Golden Rule \u00b6 When in doubt: Delete .venv , recreate it, reinstall. It\u2019s faster than debugging a broken environment. \u2699\ufe0f Advanced venv Tricks & Integrations \u00b6 \ud83e\udde0 1. Auto-activate in VS Code \u00b6 VS Code has native support for virtual environments. Open your project folder in VS Code (the one with .venv/ ). Open Command Palette \u2192 Python: Select Interpreter . Choose the one that points to .venv/bin/python (or .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe on Windows). Now every terminal inside VS Code auto-activates the venv , and \u201cRun\u201d or \u201cDebug\u201d commands use it automatically. Tip: Add this to your project\u2019s .vscode/settings.json (optional, but nice): { \"python.defaultInterpreterPath\" : \".venv/bin/python\" } \ud83d\udc1a 2. Auto-activate when entering folder (shell-level trick) \u00b6 If you live in your terminal, you can make the venv activate automatically whenever you cd into the project. For bash or zsh : \u00b6 Append to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc : # Auto-activate venv when entering project folder cd () { builtin cd \" $@ \" || return if [ -f \".venv/bin/activate\" ] ; then source .venv/bin/activate fi } That makes the environment self-starting \u2014 no more \u201cforgot to activate\u201d moments. \ud83d\udc33 3. Use venv in Docker (for consistent builds) \u00b6 You usually don\u2019t need venv inside Docker because Docker itself isolates environments \u2014 but it\u2019s sometimes useful when developing locally and deploying via container. A typical lightweight pattern: FROM python:3.11-slim WORKDIR /app COPY . . RUN python3 -m venv /venv ENV PATH = \"/venv/bin: $PATH \" RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt CMD [ \"mkdocs\" , \"serve\" , \"-a\" , \"0.0.0.0:8000\" ] This way, the container runs everything inside /venv , giving full reproducibility between your laptop and the container. \ud83d\udd04 4. Use venv in CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.) \u00b6 Virtual environments integrate beautifully in automation. Example GitHub Actions job for MkDocs: jobs : build : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v4 - uses : actions/setup-python@v5 with : python-version : '3.11' - run : python -m venv .venv - run : source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt - run : source .venv/bin/activate && mkdocs build That ensures each run is clean, reproducible, and isolated \u2014 no dependency drift over time. \ud83e\udde9 5. Use venv executables directly (no activation needed) \u00b6 Sometimes automation scripts shouldn\u2019t depend on interactive activation. You can run any installed tool directly from inside .venv/bin : .venv/bin/mkdocs serve That works even if the venv isn\u2019t \u201cactivated.\u201d It\u2019s cleaner in scripts, cron jobs, or Dockerfiles. \ud83e\uddf9 6. Clean up and reset your environment fast \u00b6 When you want a fresh start: rm -rf .venv site/ __pycache__/ python3 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt That gives you a sterile lab again, like hitting \u201creset\u201d on a scientific experiment. \ud83e\udde0 Rule of Thumb for Power Users \u00b6 Local dev \u2192 always use .venv Dockerized app \u2192 system Python inside container is fine, or one global /venv CI/CD \u2192 recreate venv per run for reliability Next level from here would be environment management tools like: pip-tools \u2192 for precise dependency pinning poetry \u2192 combines venv + dependency management + packaging pyenv \u2192 handles multiple Python versions on one system","title":".venv"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/python/environments/venv/#python-virtual-environments-venv-cheatsheet","text":"","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Python Virtual Environments (venv) \u2014 Cheatsheet"},{"location":"cheatsheets/languages/python/environments/venv/#what-it-is","text":"venv means virtual environment .

See also: HTTP State Evolution 1) The Core Problem \u00b6 HTTP by design has no memory . Each request is independent \u2014 the server doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s you returning unless you tell it every time. So to build logins, carts, dashboards, and \u201cremember me\u201d experiences, we need a state mechanism \u2014 something that links separate requests together. Three main patterns exist: Mechanism Where State Lives Common Use Sessions On the server Web apps, classic login Cookies On the client (browser) Store session IDs, small data Tokens On the client (API world) JWTs, OAuth access tokens 2) Sessions \u2014 The Old but Gold Approach \u00b6 \ud83e\udde9 Idea \u00b6 Store a \u201csession record\u201d on the server \u2014 usually a hash map like: sessionId -> { userId: 42, role: \"admin\", cart: [...] } The client just holds a random session ID: Cookie: sessionId=abc123 The server looks it up on every request. \u2699\ufe0f How It Works \u00b6 User logs in with username/password. Server creates a session in memory or database. Server sends the session ID to the client as a cookie. Client sends it with every request. \ud83d\udca1 Pros \u00b6 Easy to invalidate ( delete sessionId server-side). Works with simple cookies (no JWT complexity). Secure if server stores minimal data. \u26a0\ufe0f Cons \u00b6 Doesn\u2019t scale easily across multiple servers unless you share session storage (Redis, database, etc.). Not ideal for stateless APIs. Example \u00b6 POST /login \u2192 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure GET /profile \u2192 Cookie: sessionId=abc123 3) Cookies \u2014 The Tiny Carriers of State \u00b6 Cookies are small text blobs (\u22484KB each) stored by browsers per origin. They automatically attach to every HTTP request to that site. \ud83c\udf6c Example \u00b6 Set-Cookie: theme=dark; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Lax Browser then adds: Cookie: theme=dark \ud83e\udde0 Key Attributes \u00b6 Attribute Meaning Domain which host(s) can read it Path restrict cookie to part of site Expires / Max-Age when to delete it Secure only send over HTTPS HttpOnly JS can\u2019t access it (prevents XSS stealing) SameSite controls cross-site sending (prevents CSRF) \ud83d\udd12 Security baseline \u00b6 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict 4) Tokens \u2014 Modern, Stateless Authentication \u00b6 Tokens shift state to the client , so servers don\u2019t store sessions. They\u2019re ideal for APIs, SPAs, and mobile apps. The two main types: Token Type Format Where Stored Expiry JWT (JSON Web Token) signed JSON localStorage / cookie short-lived (mins\u2013hrs) Opaque Token random ID server DB lookup flexible \ud83d\udd27 JWT Example \u00b6 Header.Payload.Signature \u2014 all Base64 encoded. { \"sub\" : \"42\" , \"name\" : \"Edgaras\" , \"exp\" : 1737000000 } JWTs are signed with a secret (HMAC) or private key (RSA). The server verifies the signature \u2014 no DB lookup needed. Typical Flow \u00b6 User logs in \u2192 server returns access_token + refresh_token . Client stores them (preferably in memory or httpOnly cookie ). Sends token in every request: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR... 4. When access token expires, client uses refresh token to get a new one. \ud83d\udca1 Pros \u00b6 Perfect for distributed / stateless backends. Scales easily. Easy to integrate with mobile / third-party clients. \u26a0\ufe0f Cons \u00b6 Harder to invalidate before expiry (you can only blacklist). Token theft = full impersonation until expiry. 5) Cookies vs Tokens \u2014 The Real Difference \u00b6 Aspect Cookie Session Token-based State stored Server-side Client-side Transport Automatic via browser Manual in Authorization header Invalidation Easy (delete on server) Harder (must track blacklists) Scalability Requires shared session store Scales horizontally Works with Browser + HTML apps APIs, SPAs, mobile apps CSRF risk Yes Minimal (if no cookies used) 6) Mixing Cookies & Tokens (Hybrid Pattern) \u00b6 Modern secure apps often use tokens inside cookies . Set-Cookie: access_token=<JWT>; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict Benefits: Automatic sending like sessions. JWT\u2019s stateless verification. HttpOnly flag protects from JS theft. Used by major frameworks like NextAuth , Spring Security , and Django Rest Framework . 7) Refresh Tokens \u00b6 To balance security and convenience , many systems use two tokens: Type Lifetime Purpose Access token short (5\u201315 min) Used for API requests Refresh token long (days\u2013weeks) Used to get new access token The refresh token is sent only to /auth/refresh endpoint \u2014 not every request. 8) CSRF & XSS \u2014 The Twin Threats \u00b6 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) \u00b6 When attacker tricks browser into sending a cookie-authenticated request. Prevent with: SameSite=Strict or Lax cookies. CSRF token in form submissions. Use of Authorization header instead of cookies for APIs. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) \u00b6 When injected JS steals tokens or cookies. Prevent with: HttpOnly cookies. Strict Content-Security-Policy. Input sanitization. 9) Practical Example \u2014 Login Flow Comparison \u00b6 \ud83c\udf6a Cookie-based (Sessions) \u00b6 POST /login \u2192 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure GET /dashboard \u2192 Cookie: sessionId=abc123 \ud83e\ude99 Token-based (JWT) \u00b6 POST /login \u2192 { \"access_token\": \"eyJ...\", \"refresh_token\": \"eyJ...\" } GET /profile \u2192 Authorization: Bearer eyJ... 10) Quick Recap \u2014 What to Use When \u00b6 Use Case Recommended Classic server-rendered site Sessions + Cookies REST API / mobile app JWTs (access + refresh tokens) Microservices / distributed JWTs or opaque tokens with gateway validation Sensitive data / high security Short-lived tokens + HttpOnly cookies Public API API keys (simple token variant) 11) Java & Spring Quick Hooks \u00b6 Session Example \u00b6 @PostMapping ( \"/login\" ) public ResponseEntity <?> login ( HttpSession session ) { session . setAttribute ( \"user\" , user ); return ResponseEntity . ok (). build (); } JWT Filter Example \u00b6 String authHeader = request . getHeader ( \"Authorization\" ); if ( authHeader != null && authHeader . startsWith ( \"Bearer \" )) { String token = authHeader . substring ( 7 ); Claims claims = jwtUtil . validateToken ( token ); // attach user info to security context } 12) Pocket Glossary \u00b6 Session: server-side memory of a user\u2019s state. Cookie: key-value pair stored on client, sent automatically with requests. Token: signed credential representing a user (e.g., JWT). Refresh token: used to issue new access tokens. CSRF: tricking browser into unintended requests. XSS: injecting scripts that run in a user\u2019s browser. 13) Summary Thought \u00b6 HTTP forgets.

Environments and Their Roles \u00b6 Environment Purpose Key Tools Local Fast iteration, testing Docker Compose, local DB Staging Full stack replica Docker Compose, CI/CD Production Stable live system Docker, systemd, Nginx CI Runner Automated testing GitHub Actions / GitLab CI Golden rule: Each environment should be identical in architecture, differing only in configuration. \ud83e\uddf1 3. Stack Layers Overview \u00b6 Layer Component Purpose Source Control Git Version all code and infrastructure Build Layer Node.js, Gradle/Maven Build frontend + backend artifacts Runtime Layer Docker Run isolated containers Routing Layer Nginx Route external traffic Data Layer PostgreSQL, Redis Persistent + cached data Orchestration Layer systemd Ensure uptime and startup order Automation Layer CI/CD Test, build, and deploy automatically Observation Layer Prometheus, Grafana, Logs Metrics, alerts, traces \ud83d\udc33 4. Docker Compose for Unified Stack \u00b6 The glue that connects your local and staging environments. version : \"3.9\" services : nginx : image : nginx:latest ports : - \"80:80\" volumes : - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro depends_on : [ backend , frontend ] frontend : build : ./frontend expose : - \"5173\" backend : build : ./backend environment : SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL : jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/appdb SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME : devuser SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD : secret depends_on : [ postgres , redis ] postgres : image : postgres:16 volumes : - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data redis : image : redis:7 volumes : - redis_data:/data volumes : pg_data : redis_data : This setup runs the entire full stack locally, exactly as it would in staging or production. \ud83d\udd01 5. CI/CD Pipeline Flow \u00b6 Continuous Integration (CI) ensures your build works and tests pass. Continuous Deployment (CD) delivers it safely to your server. Example (GitHub Actions) \u00b6 name : Build & Deploy Full Stack on : push : branches : [ main ] jobs : build : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v4 - name : Build backend run : ./gradlew build - name : Build frontend run : npm ci && npm run build - name : Build Docker images run : | docker build -t ghcr.io/user/backend:${{ github.sha }} backend/ docker build -t ghcr.io/user/frontend:${{ github.sha }} frontend/ - name : Push Images run : | docker push ghcr.io/user/backend:${{ github.sha }} docker push ghcr.io/user/frontend:${{ github.sha }} deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest needs : build steps : - name : SSH & Deploy run : | ssh user@server \" docker pull ghcr.io/user/backend:${{ github.sha }} && docker pull ghcr.io/user/frontend:${{ github.sha }} && docker compose up -d && sudo systemctl reload nginx \" This pipeline: Builds both backend and frontend. Pushes images to a container registry. SSHes into the server and redeploys. Reloads Nginx to apply new frontend files. \u26a1 6. Deployment Directory Structure (on server) \u00b6 /opt/app/ \u251c\u2500 docker-compose.yml \u251c\u2500 nginx.conf \u251c\u2500 .env \u251c\u2500 frontend/ \u251c\u2500 backend/ \u251c\u2500 logs/ \u2514\u2500 volumes/ \u251c\u2500 postgres/ \u2514\u2500 redis/ systemd runs Docker as the service manager underneath: sudo systemctl restart docker sudo docker compose up -d \ud83e\udde9 7. Nginx as the Traffic Controller \u00b6 Handles requests, SSL, static serving, and proxying: server { listen 80 ; server_name example.com ; location / { root /usr/share/nginx/html ; try_files $uri /index.html ; } location /api/ { proxy_pass http://backend:8080 ; } } Nginx routes browser traffic \u2192 frontend, and /api calls \u2192 backend \u2192 PostgreSQL/Redis. \ud83d\udc18 8. Databases and Persistence \u00b6 PostgreSQL \u00b6 Stores structured, durable data. Mounted via Docker volume ( pg_data ). Managed by systemd through Docker. Redis \u00b6 In-memory caching + sessions. Mounted volume for optional persistence ( redis_data ). Communicates over internal Docker network. \ud83e\udde0 9. Configuration & Secrets Management \u00b6 All environments read from .env files: DB_USER=devuser DB_PASS=secret REDIS_PASS=redispass API_KEY=some_key For production: Use .env.prod with stronger creds. Never commit secrets \u2014 use CI/CD secrets storage. \ud83d\udcbe 10. Backup & Recovery \u00b6 PostgreSQL backup: \u00b6 pg_dump -U devuser appdb | gzip > backup_ $( date +%F ) .sql.gz Redis snapshot: \u00b6 redis-cli save Automate backups with systemd timers or cron. \ud83e\udded 11. Monitoring & Logging \u00b6 Tool Purpose journalctl OS & service logs Docker logs Container-level events Prometheus Metrics collection Grafana Visualization & alerts ELK stack (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) Centralized logging Minimal local setup: docker run -d -p 9090 :9090 prom/prometheus docker run -d -p 3000 :3000 grafana/grafana \ud83d\udd12 12. Security Layers \u00b6 Layer Defense Network Nginx firewall rules, fail2ban Transport HTTPS via Let\u2019s Encrypt Application Authentication, rate limiting Data Encrypted DB connections Access SSH keys, non-root Docker users Secrets Environment variables in CI/CD secrets store \ud83d\udd01 13. Continuous Maintenance Workflow \u00b6 Task Tool Frequency Code updates Git Continuous Build & deploy CI/CD On every push Logs review journalctl / Grafana Daily Backup rotation systemd timer Daily/weekly Security patches apt, Docker images Weekly Service healthcheck systemctl, Prometheus Ongoing \ud83e\udde9 14. Disaster Recovery Pattern \u00b6 Restore from latest DB + Redis backups. Pull latest images from registry. Deploy via docker compose up -d . Reconnect DNS / certificates. Verify via Nginx health endpoints. Recovery time objective: minutes, not hours. \ud83e\udde0 15. Developer-to-Production Mental Model \u00b6 Role Tool Responsibility Developer Git, Docker Build and test features Integrator CI Verify builds Deployer CD Push working containers live Operator systemd Keep services healthy Observer Grafana/Logs Detect issues early \u2705 16. Summary \u00b6 Git \u2192 tracks source and triggers builds. Docker \u2192 standardizes runtime. Nginx \u2192 routes traffic to services. PostgreSQL \u2192 stores persistent state. Redis \u2192 accelerates performance. systemd \u2192 ensures everything starts and stays alive. CI/CD \u2192 automates the entire loop. Monitoring tools \u2192 give visibility and peace of mind.

It\u2019s the tool that powers GitHub, GitLab, and most of modern software development. \u2699\ufe0f 1. What Git Actually Does \u00b6 Git records snapshots of your project (commits), not just diffs. Each commit stores the entire state of your code at that moment, compressed efficiently. You can move through history (like checkpoints in a game), branch off to experiment, and merge or rebase to integrate changes. # See history git log --oneline --graph --decorate \ud83d\udc49 In short: Git is your project\u2019s time machine + collaboration layer . \ud83e\uddf1 2. Core Concepts \u00b6 Concept Description Repository (repo) A Git-managed folder containing code and version history ( .git folder inside). Commit A snapshot of your files at a moment in time. Branch A movable pointer to a commit \u2014 allows parallel development. HEAD Your current working branch (where you are in history). Staging area Where you prepare changes before committing. Remote A copy of your repo hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub). Merge Combines histories from different branches. Rebase Moves commits onto a new base, creating a linear history. \u2692\ufe0f 3. The Git Workflow (mental model) \u00b6 Working Directory \u2192 Staging Area \u2192 Local Repository \u2192 Remote Repository Edit files \u2192 git add Save snapshot \u2192 git commit Share/pull changes \u2192 git push / git pull \ud83d\udd27 4. Quick Command Reference \u00b6 Initialize or Clone \u00b6 git init # start a new repo git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git Inspect \u00b6 git status # show changed files git diff # show unstaged changes git log --oneline --graph --decorate Stage and Commit \u00b6 git add file.txt # stage file git add . # stage all changes git commit -m \"Add new feature\" # create commit Branch and Merge \u00b6 git branch # list branches git switch -c feature/login # create + switch git merge feature/login # merge into current branch git branch -d feature/login # delete local branch Sync with Remote \u00b6 git remote -v # show remotes git fetch # get new data, no merge git pull # fetch + merge current branch git push origin main # upload local commits \ud83c\udf3f 5. Branching and Collaboration Patterns \u00b6 Main workflow: main \u251c\u2500 feature/login \u251c\u2500 feature/dashboard \u2514\u2500 fix/typo Branch naming convention: feature/\u2026 , fix/\u2026 , refactor/\u2026 , release/\u2026 Recommended pattern: main \u2014 stable release branch develop \u2014 active integration branch feature/* \u2014 short-lived branches hotfix/* \u2014 emergency fixes release/* \u2014 prep for deployment \u26a1 6. Undoing and Time Travel \u00b6 git restore file.txt # discard unstaged changes git restore --staged file.txt # unstage git checkout <commit> -- file.txt # restore from old commit git reset --soft HEAD~1 # undo last commit, keep changes staged git reset --hard HEAD~1 # undo commit + changes git revert <commit> # create new commit that undoes another \ud83d\udc49 reset rewrites history; revert adds a new commit that undoes previous work safely. Caution Attention when rewriting history on shared branches! Update the remote to match your local (force rewrite remote branch): # safer force (recommended even when alone) git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch> # or force (less safe) git push --force origin <your-branch> Notes: --force-with-lease prevents clobbering a remote you don\u2019t expect \u2014 it fails if remote changed since you last fetched. If you accidentally delete something, git reflog can usually recover the commit SHA. \ud83e\udde9 7. Working with Remotes (GitHub, etc.) \u00b6 git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git git push -u origin main Next time, just: git push git pull Clone and work: git clone <url> git switch -c feature/branch Sync fork or upstream: git remote add upstream https://github.com/source/repo.git git fetch upstream git merge upstream/main \ud83e\uddf0 8. Real-World Example (Feature Workflow) \u00b6 # Start new work git switch -c feature/login # Edit code git add . git commit -m \"Implement login feature\" # Update main and rebase to stay up-to-date git fetch origin git rebase origin/main # Push branch for review git push -u origin feature/login # After merge, clean up git switch main git pull git branch -d feature/login \ud83e\uddfc 9. Maintenance and Cleanup \u00b6 git branch -vv # see tracking info git fetch -p # prune deleted remote branches git gc # clean up unnecessary files and optimize repo \ud83e\udde0 10. Common Troubleshooting \u00b6 Problem Fix Accidentally committed wrong file git reset HEAD~1 then re-commit Merge conflict Edit conflicted file \u2192 git add . \u2192 git commit Detached HEAD git switch main to reattach \u201cnon-fast-forward\u201d error on push Pull first ( git pull --rebase ) then push again Wrong commit message git commit --amend -m \"New message\" \ud83e\udde9 11. Advanced Tools (for later) \u00b6 Rebase vs Merge: Rebase keeps history linear, merge preserves branching. Cherry-pick: apply specific commits between branches. git cherry-pick <commit> * Stash: temporarily save changes. git stash git stash pop * Hooks: automate pre-commit checks and CI workflows. * Submodules: include external repos inside your repo. \u2705 Summary \u00b6 Git snapshots your code and lets you time-travel safely. Commits build your local history, remotes sync it across the team. Branches isolate work; merges and rebases integrate it. git status and git log are your best debugging friends. Never panic \u2014 you can almost always recover history in Git. \ud83e\udded Next Step Ideas \u00b6 When you outgrow this refresher: Split into git-basics.md , git-advanced.md , git-troubleshooting.md Add practical guides for branching strategies or GitHub workflows. \ud83d\udcc4 File path suggestion: docs/ \u2514\u2500 cheatsheets/ \u2514\u2500 tools/ \u2514\u2500 git/ \u2514\u2500 quick-start.md \ud83d\udcbb 12. Git in Your IDE (JetBrains & VS Code) \u00b6 Git isn\u2019t just a command-line tool \u2014 every modern IDE wraps it into a visual workflow. But it helps to understand what each action actually does under the hood. \ud83e\udde9 JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.) \u00b6 Action What It Actually Does Commit (Ctrl+K) Stages & commits changes locally. Equivalent to git add + git commit . Push (Ctrl+Shift+K) Uploads commits to the remote ( git push ). Update Project (Ctrl+T) Fetch + merge (or rebase, if configured). Rebase Onto Upstream Equivalent to git rebase origin/main . Keeps history clean. Show History (Alt+9 \u2192 Log tab) Visual git log + branch graph. Cherry-pick Commit Applies selected commit(s) onto your branch ( git cherry-pick ). Shelve Changes JetBrains' own version of git stash \u2014 great for quick context switches. \ud83d\udc49 Pro tip: JetBrains auto-detects Git roots. If a folder contains .git , it treats it as a repo automatically. Good workflow habit inside JetBrains: 1. Regularly commit small, meaningful chunks. 2. Rebase before pushing to keep branches fast-forwardable. 3. Always inspect your commit diff before confirming. \ud83e\udde0 VS Code Integration \u00b6 VS Code\u2019s Source Control panel is a friendly wrapper around core Git commands. Icon Action Git Equivalent \u2713 Commit git commit \u2b06\ufe0f Push git push \u2b07\ufe0f Pull git pull \ud83d\udd01 Sync Changes Pull + Push \u2295 Stage Change git add \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Discard Change git restore Extensions worth adding: - GitLens \u2192 deep history, blame, branch insights. - Git Graph \u2192 visual branching and merges. - GitHub Pull Requests \u2192 manage PRs directly in VS Code. \u270d\ufe0f 13. Writing Great Commit Messages \u00b6 Clear commit messages are part of professional hygiene. A Git log should read like a timeline of meaningful decisions, not noise. Format (conventional style): <type>(scope): short summary [optional body] [optional footer] Examples: feat(auth): add JWT token validation fix(api): correct null pointer on user fetch docs(readme): add setup instructions refactor(core): simplify cache layer Common types: Type Meaning feat new feature fix bug fix docs documentation change refactor code restructure without behavior change test adding or fixing tests chore maintenance or tooling changes \ud83d\udc49 A good commit message should explain why a change exists, not just what changed. \ud83e\udde9 14. Practical Git + IDE Workflow Example \u00b6 Here\u2019s how a typical developer loop looks: Start new work git switch -c feature/login (Or use JetBrains \u201cNew Branch\u201d button.) Code \u2192 test \u2192 commit Stage meaningful changes Commit with a clear message: feat(login): add session management Stay up to date git fetch origin git rebase origin/main (Or \u201cRebase onto Main\u201d in IDE.) Push for review git push -u origin feature/login (Or \u201cPush\u201d in IDE.) After PR merge git switch main git pull git branch -d feature/login (Or \u201cDelete Branch\u201d safely in IDE.) \ud83e\uddfc 15. Tips for Clean Repositories \u00b6 Keep .gitignore tight \u2014 no IDE caches or .venv/ folders. Avoid committing binaries, logs, or secrets. Use .gitattributes to manage line endings across systems. Squash small commits before merging to keep history readable: ```bash git rebase -i HEAD~5 ```` Use git tag for versioning: bash git tag -a v1.0.0 -m \"Initial release\" git push origin v1.0.0 \u2705 Final Notes \u00b6 The IDE is just a lens \u2014 Git remains the same underneath. Always review the diff before committing. Favor small, focused commits over massive all-in-one pushes. Treat your Git history as a story \u2014 future you will thank you.","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"cheatsheets/tools/git/quick-start/#git-from-basics-to-advanced-workflow-mastery","text":"Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) \u2014 it tracks changes to files over time, lets developers collaborate, and makes every clone a complete backup of the repository.

What systemd Actually Does \u00b6 When Linux boots, systemd : 1. Mounts file systems. 2. Spawns essential processes. 3. Starts all enabled services. 4. Manages dependencies and restarts on failure. It replaces older systems like SysVinit and upstart , providing faster parallel startup and fine-grained control. \ud83d\udc49 In short: systemd is the conductor ; services are the instruments . \ud83e\udde9 2.

If not there \u2192 use Flatpak (Flathub). Still missing \u2192 add vendor repo . If things act weird \u2192 sudo dnf clean all && sudo dnf makecache . \ud83d\udcda Understanding dnf config-manager \u00b6 \ud83d\udd27 What is dnf config-manager ? \u00b6 config-manager is a subcommand (plugin) of dnf . It\u2019s not installed by default on minimal Fedora systems, but it comes with the package dnf-plugins-core . If you don\u2019t have it, install it: sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core Once installed, you get extra commands like dnf config-manager . \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f What does it do? \u00b6 It\u2019s used to manage DNF/YUM repo configurations . Think of it as a helper to enable, disable, or add new repositories without manually editing files. \ud83d\udea9 Common Flags (Options) \u00b6 --add-repo <url> \u2192 Add a new repository (from a .repo file or repo URL). --set-enabled <repoid> \u2192 Enable a repo that exists but is disabled. --set-disabled <repoid> \u2192 Disable a repo temporarily or permanently. Example: \u00b6 Enable the fedora-modular repo: sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled fedora-modular Disable it: sudo dnf config-manager --set-disabled fedora-modular \ud83d\uddc2 Manual Alternative \u00b6 Without config-manager , you could manually place .repo files into: /etc/yum.repos.d/ Each .repo file is just a config text file telling DNF where to fetch packages. Example file /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo : [docker-ce-stable] name = Docker CE Stable - $basearch baseurl = https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/$releasever/$basearch/stable enabled = 1 gpgcheck = 1 gpgkey = https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/gpg \u2705 Summary: dnf config-manager = a helper command from dnf-plugins-core . --add-repo = quick way to add new repos. Other useful flags: --set-enabled , --set-disabled .

Recommended Obsidian settings: Files & Links \u2192 Use [[Wikilinks]] : On Files & Links \u2192 New link format : Shortest Files & Links \u2192 Default location for new notes : Same folder as current file Editor \u2192 Show frontmatter : On 2.5) Obsidian setup (optional but useful) \u00b6 Core plugins to enable Backlinks, Outgoing Links \u2192 fast x-ref navigation Templates \u2192 front-matter snippets Daily Notes (optional) \u2192 scratchpad/logs that won\u2019t be published Community plugins that play nicely with MkDocs Material Admonition \u2014 renders MkDocs !!! note|tip|warning blocks inside Obsidian . Use this in your notes so one syntax works everywhere: !!! tip Use the search bar for method names, error snippets, or concepts. Advanced Tables (or Table Editor 2) \u2014 auto-align pipes, tab to next column. Linter \u2014 auto-fix headings, trailing spaces, YAML ordering (keep title/tags/summary neat). Templater \u2014 quick scaffolds for cheatsheets/concepts. Example templates: --- title: <% tp.file.title %> \u2014 Quickref tags: [cheatsheet, <topic>, <tech>] summary: One-liner for why this exists. --- # <% tp.file.title %> \u2014 Quickref > See concepts: [concepts/...](<../../../concepts/...>) --- title: <% tp.file.title %> tags: [concept, <domain>] summary: What it is, why it matters, trade-offs. --- # <% tp.file.title %> > See cheatsheet: [cheatsheets/...](<../../...>) Markdown Attributes \u2014 previews {#id .class} so Obsidian shows what attr_list does in MkDocs. Paste URL into Selection \u2014 speeds up linking text \u2192 [text](url) . Tag Wrangler \u2014 bulk-rename/merge tags. Obsidian Git (optional) \u2014 commit/pull from inside Obsidian if you\u2019re not using IDEA for VCS. Nice-to-have (safe, but non-exporting) Dataview \u2014 dashboards/lists in the vault. Remember: Dataview queries don\u2019t render in MkDocs . Use it for in-vault discovery, not for pages you publish, or export the results as static lists before publishing. Syntax alignment cheats Admonitions: Prefer MkDocs syntax ( !!! note ) + Admonition plugin \u2192 same source renders well in both places. Avoid Obsidian callouts ( > [!NOTE] ) if you want one true syntax. Tabs: pymdownx.tabbed looks great on the site but won\u2019t render as tabs inside Obsidian. In notes, keep tab blocks short; Obsidian will show them as plain headings\u2014good enough for editing. Wikilinks: Keep writing [[wikilinks]] . mkdocs-obsidian resolves them on build, so reorganizing folders won\u2019t break links. Ignore these in publish Your .obsidian/ stays out of the site\u2014already covered by: excluded_dirs: ['.obsidian', '.trash'] and .gitignore should include: .obsidian/ .trash/ Gotchas Dataview, buttons, or any Obsidian-only syntax isn\u2019t rendered by MkDocs. Keep publishable pages in plain Markdown + MkDocs features. If Linter rewrites YAML keys, make sure it doesn\u2019t nuke custom fields you care about. If you switch to Obsidian callouts, you\u2019ll need a pre-processor to convert them to !!! blocks; staying with !!! avoids that whole dance. 3) Create folders fast (scaffold) \u00b6 Run in repo root ( knowledge-vault/ ).

No. index.md is content , not configuration. It\u2019s a curated landing page for the folder. The site structure is driven by the filesystem and (optionally) the nav: in mkdocs.yml . 6) Front-matter templates (copy/paste into pages) \u00b6 Cheatsheet: --- title: <Title> \u2014 Quickref tags: [cheatsheet, <topic>, <tech>] summary: One-line reason this exists (lookup while coding). --- # <Title> \u2014 Quickref > See concepts: [concepts/...](<../../../concepts/...>) Concept: --- title: <Concept Name> tags: [concept, <domain>] summary: What it is, why it matters, trade-offs. --- # <Concept Name> > See cheatsheet: [cheatsheets/...](<../../...>) 7) Local dev & deploy \u00b6 # Local preview (auto-reload) mkdocs serve # open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ # Deploy to GitHub Pages mkdocs gh-deploy # your site: https://<your-username>.github.io/knowledge-vault/ 8) FAQ / Gotchas \u00b6 Where should README.md live? At repo root. It explains the project + how to run/deploy. The site homepage is docs/index.md . Do I need docs_dir: docs ? No. That\u2019s the default; keeping it implicit is cleaner. What makes /cheatsheets/ and /concepts/ routes work? The index.md files in those folders + use_directory_urls: true . What if I move files around? [[wikilinks]] are updated by mkdocs-obsidian on build. Rebuild after reorganizing. Should I curate nav: now? Early on, skip it. When structure stabilizes, un-comment nav: in mkdocs.yml to control order and labels. 9) Mental model (why this works) \u00b6 Separation of concerns: README.md (GitHub), docs/index.md (site), mkdocs.yml (wiring). Two modes = less friction: Cheatsheets for speed, Concepts for depth. Wikilinks = future-proof: Rearrange folders without rewriting links. Indexes = clean URLs: Section index.md gives /cheatsheets/ and /concepts/ real landing pages. Ship it. Then iterate.

It\u2019s lightweight, event-driven, and designed to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resources. You\u2019ll find it serving static sites, routing API traffic, proxying backend apps, or terminating SSL \u2014 often all at once. \u2699\ufe0f 1. What Nginx Actually Does \u00b6 Nginx can play multiple roles depending on configuration: Role Description Web server Serves static files directly (HTML, JS, CSS, images). Reverse proxy Forwards client requests to backend apps (e.g., Node, Spring Boot). Load balancer Distributes requests across multiple backend servers. TLS terminator Handles HTTPS encryption before passing traffic internally. Cache layer Stores responses to reduce backend load. \ud83d\udc49 In short: Nginx sits between the internet and your application , managing how traffic flows. \ud83e\uddf1 2. Core Concepts \u00b6 Concept Description Worker processes Handle client connections. Nginx scales by using multiple workers efficiently. Directives Configuration commands that define behavior (e.g., listen , server_name ). Context blocks Hierarchical sections: main , http , server , and location . Server block Defines a virtual host \u2014 domain, ports, SSL, routes. Location block Defines how to handle requests matching specific URIs. \ud83e\udde9 3. File Structure Overview \u00b6 Typical Linux layout after install: /etc/nginx/ \u251c\u2500 nginx.conf # main config (includes others) \u251c\u2500 conf.d/ # custom site configs (enabled by default) \u251c\u2500 sites-available/ # optional (Debian/Ubuntu layout) \u251c\u2500 sites-enabled/ # symlinks to active sites \u251c\u2500 snippets/ # reusable config fragments \u2514\u2500 logs/ \u251c\u2500 access.log \u2514\u2500 error.log Test and reload Nginx safely: sudo nginx -t # test syntax sudo systemctl reload nginx sudo systemctl status nginx \ud83e\uddf0 4. Basic HTTP Server Example \u00b6 Goal: Serve static files from /var/www/html on port 80. server { listen 80 ; server_name example.com ; root /var/www/html ; index index.html ; access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log ; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log ; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ = 404 ; } } \ud83d\udc49 This is Nginx as a pure web server \u2014 no proxying, just serving files. \ud83d\udd01 5. Reverse Proxy Setup \u00b6 Goal: Forward traffic from Nginx \u2192 backend app (e.g., Spring Boot or Node). server { listen 80 ; server_name api.example.com ; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080 ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; } } \u2705 Best practice: Always pass client IP headers. Use proxy_pass without trailing slash unless you understand path rewriting. Protect upstreams (never expose raw app ports to the internet). \ud83d\udd12 6. HTTPS (TLS) Configuration \u00b6 Using Let\u2019s Encrypt certificates (managed by certbot ): sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com Manual example: server { listen 443 ssl ; server_name example.com ; ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem ; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem ; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080 ; } } server { listen 80 ; server_name example.com ; return 301 https:// $host$request_uri ; } \ud83d\udc49 Always redirect HTTP \u2192 HTTPS. \u26a1 7. Load Balancing Example \u00b6 Round-robin across two backend servers: upstream backend_cluster { server 10.0.0.2 : 8080 ; server 10.0.0.3 : 8080 ; } server { listen 80 ; server_name app.example.com ; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_cluster ; } } Variants: ip_hash; for sticky sessions least_conn; for even load \ud83e\udde0 8. Useful Directives & Variables \u00b6 Directive Purpose root Directory to serve files from index Default file to serve server_name Hostname match for requests error_page Custom error responses rewrite URL rewriting try_files Fallbacks for static serving proxy_pass Forward to backend proxy_set_header Pass headers to backend Common variables: $remote_addr \u2192 client IP $host \u2192 domain in request $uri \u2192 path part of request $request_uri \u2192 original request including query $upstream_addr \u2192 backend server used \ud83e\udde9 9.

Best Practices & Developer Habits \u00b6 Configuration Hygiene \u00b6 Keep production configs readonly and version-controlled. Split by domain or role \u2014 one file per app. Use includes: include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf ; Developer sanity checklist \u00b6 Always run nginx -t before reload. Use $host and $remote_addr headers when proxying. Don\u2019t run with root inside containers (use nginx user). Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS \u2014 even locally, if possible. Keep logs rotated ( logrotate or Docker log limits). IDE habit \u00b6 Format configs automatically before commit. Use pre-commit hooks to validate syntax: nginx -t -q || exit 1 \u2705 Summary (Developer Edition) \u00b6 Integrate Nginx directly in IDE or Compose \u2014 no manual SSH needed. Test configs automatically before reloads. Run the same Nginx image locally and in production for consistency. Version-control your .conf files like code \u2014 because they are code.

JVM \u2014 The Beating Heart of Java \u00b6 The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the engine that runs your compiled Java code. It doesn\u2019t run .java source files directly. You write code, the compiler ( javac ) translates it into bytecode ( .class files) , and the JVM interprets or JIT-compiles that bytecode into real CPU instructions. Think of the JVM as: A simulated computer inside your computer . It handles memory, threads, exceptions, and cross-platform behavior. The JVM is platform-dependent , but Java bytecode is platform-independent \u2014 that\u2019s how Java stays \u201cwrite once, run anywhere\u201d. 2. JVM Memory \u2014 Heap and Metaspace \u00b6 Inside the JVM, memory is divided into several regions. The most important: \ud83e\udde0 Heap \u00b6 Where objects live . Created when you use new . Garbage Collected (GC) when no references remain. Divided into generations: Young (Eden + Survivor) and Old (Tenured) space. \ud83d\udcd8 Metaspace \u00b6 Where class metadata lives (replaced \u201cPermGen\u201d from Java 8+). Stores the structure of each loaded class (its methods, fields, annotations, etc.). Grows dynamically; not part of the heap. \ud83e\udde9 Others (for completeness) \u00b6 Stack \u2014 each thread gets its own, holds method calls and local variables. PC Register \u2014 keeps track of which instruction a thread is executing. Native Method Area \u2014 used when calling C/C++ code through JNI. 3. Object \u2014 The Root of Everything \u00b6 Everything that lives on the heap is an Object (or derived from it). Object is the universal superclass \u2014 the ancestor of all Java classes. It defines the methods that all Java entities inherit: toString() , equals() , hashCode() , etc. When you create an object: User user = new User ( \"Alice\" ); You\u2019re creating an instance in the heap, and the JVM knows which class definition it belongs to \u2014 that definition lives in Metaspace . 4. Class<?> \u2014 The Blueprint of a Type \u00b6 Every loaded class in Java has a corresponding Class<?> object in memory. This object lives in the Metaspace and acts like the blueprint for all instances of that type. You can access it like this: Class <?> clazz = User . class ; This clazz object contains: The class\u2019s name Methods Fields Constructors Annotations And the ClassLoader that loaded it This is the foundation of reflection \u2014 it lets you inspect and modify code at runtime . 5. ClassLoader \u2014 The Bridge Between Disk and Memory \u00b6 The ClassLoader is what loads class bytecode into memory and turns it into Class<?> objects. Hierarchy of loaders: Bootstrap \u2014 loads core JDK classes (like java.lang.* ) Platform \u2014 loads extension libraries Application \u2014 loads your app\u2019s classes from the classpath (Sometimes frameworks create custom loaders \u2014 like in Spring Boot or Tomcat) Think of ClassLoader as: The librarian that finds your .class file, reads it, and registers its \u201cblueprint\u201d in Metaspace. You can even get it: ClassLoader loader = User . class . getClassLoader (); 6. Reflection \u2014 Java Looking at Itself \u00b6 Reflection lets your code inspect and manipulate itself at runtime. Using the Class<?> object, you can: List all methods, fields, and constructors. Get or set field values dynamically. Call methods by name (even private ones, if you bypass access checks). Example: Class <?> clazz = User . class ; Method m = clazz . getMethod ( \"getName\" ); Object result = m . invoke ( new User ( \"Alice\" )); That line means: \u201cFind method getName in class User and call it.\u201d Reflection is powerful but also slower and riskier , because it bypasses compile-time checks. 7. JDK, JRE, and JVM \u2014 The Holy Trinity \u00b6 To run Java programs, you need these three players: Component What it is Contains JVM The virtual machine Executes bytecode JRE (Java Runtime Environment) JVM + core libraries Lets you run programs JDK (Java Development Kit) JRE + compiler + tools Lets you build programs So: If you only run apps \u2192 you need JRE. If you develop apps \u2192 you need JDK. JVM is what\u2019s actually executing inside both. 8. Spring \u2014 Reflection as a Superpower \u00b6 Spring is built on top of the reflection and classloading mechanisms. How it uses reflection: \u00b6 Dependency Injection (DI) \u2014 Finds constructors, fields, and methods annotated with @Autowired , and injects dependencies dynamically. Annotation Scanning \u2014 Uses reflection to detect annotations like @Component , @Service , etc. Proxy Creation (AOP) \u2014 Dynamically wraps beans with proxy classes at runtime. Configuration \u2014 Reads @Configuration and @Bean annotations to register beans in the ApplicationContext. When Spring starts, it: Scans your classpath Uses ClassLoaders to find .class files Builds a map of all annotated classes (via reflection) Creates bean instances and wires them together So Spring is basically a meta-program that analyzes and constructs your program using the very same JVM tools you\u2019ve now met. 9. Putting It All Together \u2014 The Flow \u00b6 source code (.java) \u2193 javac bytecode (.class) \u2193 ClassLoader Class<?> in Metaspace \u2193 Reflection Objects on Heap \u2193 Framework Magic Spring uses Reflection \u2192 Builds App Context \u2192 Injects Dependencies Everything connects: JVM runs the show Heap stores living instances Metaspace stores their blueprints ClassLoader loads those blueprints Reflection lets code see and shape those blueprints Spring automates that reflection to build entire systems dynamically Final Thought \u00b6 Java was designed for portability and safety , yet its runtime is flexible enough to rewrite its own behavior on the fly. That balance \u2014 rigid typing at compile-time, elastic introspection at runtime \u2014 is what allows frameworks like Spring to exist at all. \ud83e\udded Java Runtime & Reflection \u2014 Comprehensive Quick Starter \u00b6 A journey from the inner gears of the JVM to the elegant machinery of Spring , connecting how memory, class loading, and reflection form the foundation of modern Java. 1. JVM \u2014 The Living Machine Beneath Java \u00b6 When you run a Java program, you\u2019re not running it directly on your CPU. Your code first gets compiled into bytecode , an intermediate language designed not for any particular processor, but for a virtual one : the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM . The JVM is the living organism at the center of all Java execution. It is the software abstraction of a computer \u2014 complete with memory management, execution engine, garbage collector, and a few tricks that physical CPUs can\u2019t even dream of. It reads .class files, interprets or JIT-compiles them into native instructions, and handles all the lower-level chaos: memory allocation, stack frames, threading, and exception handling. Its most remarkable property is portability . You can compile your Java program once and run it anywhere a JVM exists \u2014 on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, or even embedded devices. The physical hardware disappears; what remains is a consistent, predictable virtual world. 2. JVM Memory \u2014 The World Inside the Machine \u00b6 Like any living system, the JVM has organs \u2014 specialized memory areas that keep everything running. The Heap \u2014 The Space of Living Objects \u00b6 The heap is where every object you create with new lives. It\u2019s dynamic, expanding and contracting as objects are born and die. The garbage collector roams this space, reclaiming memory from objects that no longer have references. To keep things efficient, the heap is divided into regions: Young Generation , where newborn objects are allocated. Old Generation , where survivors of many GC cycles live longer lives. Metaspace \u2014 Where Blueprints Reside \u00b6 If the heap holds the living objects, Metaspace holds their blueprints . When the JVM loads a class, its structure \u2014 fields, methods, annotations \u2014 is stored in Metaspace. Unlike the old PermGen space, Metaspace grows dynamically, constrained only by system memory. Every class in Java has a single shared representation in Metaspace. All instances (the objects on the heap) refer back to that single blueprint. Stacks and Other Regions \u00b6 Each thread has its own stack , which holds local variables and method call frames. There\u2019s also the Program Counter (PC) register , keeping track of which bytecode instruction a thread is executing. And then there\u2019s the native method area , where code written in C/C++ and called via JNI resides. All these parts work together like organs in a body \u2014 the heap breathing objects in and out, the stack pulsing with method calls, and Metaspace serving as the collective memory of what \"things\" exist. 3. Object \u2014 The First Citizen of the Heap \u00b6 In Java, everything that exists in the heap \u2014 every String , every ArrayList , every User \u2014 ultimately descends from one ancestor: java.lang.Object . That single class is the root of the entire Java type system. It defines the fundamental behaviors shared by all entities \u2014 the ability to be compared ( equals ), described ( toString ), and hashed ( hashCode ). When you write: User user = new User ( \"Alice\" ); you\u2019re creating an instance , an individual thing in the heap that conforms to the blueprint of the User class stored in Metaspace. The JVM knows exactly which blueprint this object follows and which methods it can use, because of the internal pointer from the object\u2019s header to its class metadata. That connection between object instance and class blueprint is the bridge between the runtime world (heap) and the static world (code). 4. Class<?> \u2014 The Blueprint of Existence \u00b6 When Java loads a class, it creates a special object in Metaspace: an instance of java.lang.Class . Yes, the definition of a class is itself represented by an object. This is one of Java\u2019s most elegant ideas \u2014 everything, even types, is data . You can get hold of it like this: Class <?> clazz = User . class ; That clazz object carries every detail about the class: its name, modifiers, methods, fields, annotations, constructors, and which loader brought it into existence. This is why the type parameter looks odd \u2014 Class<?> . The question mark ( ? ) means \u201cI don\u2019t know what specific type this represents, but it\u2019s a class of something .\u201d Each loaded class has exactly one Class object representing it. All instances of that class refer back to the same Class object. That\u2019s how the JVM maintains order and consistency: a single canonical definition per loaded type. 5. ClassLoader \u2014 The Librarian of the JVM \u00b6 Where do those Class<?> blueprints come from? From the ClassLoader , Java\u2019s librarian. The ClassLoader is responsible for finding .class files, reading their bytecode, and turning them into live Class objects stored in Metaspace. There isn\u2019t just one \u2014 ClassLoaders form a hierarchy : Bootstrap Loader loads core Java classes from the JDK ( java.lang , java.util , etc.). Platform Loader loads JDK extensions and libraries. Application Loader loads your project\u2019s classes from the classpath. Frameworks often create custom classloaders \u2014 for example, Tomcat and Spring Boot both do this to isolate applications or support hot reloading. When a class is needed, the JVM asks the appropriate ClassLoader: \u201cDo you have this one?\u201d If not, it delegates to its parent. Only when the parent can\u2019t provide it does it load the class itself. This mechanism guarantees that system classes remain consistent while still allowing user code to define its own world. 6. Reflection \u2014 Java Examining Itself \u00b6 Reflection is Java\u2019s self-awareness. It\u2019s the ability of a running program to inspect and manipulate its own structure \u2014 to look at classes, methods, and fields, and even invoke them dynamically. This capability comes from those Class<?> objects sitting in Metaspace. Once you have a Class<?> , you can start exploring: Class <?> clazz = User . class ; Method m = clazz . getDeclaredMethod ( \"getName\" ); Object result = m . invoke ( new User ( \"Alice\" )); This is Java code calling methods by name , discovered at runtime, not compile time. It\u2019s slower and more dangerous \u2014 because you lose static type safety \u2014 but extraordinarily powerful. Reflection enables frameworks to perform meta-programming : code that writes or modifies other code dynamically. 7. JDK, JRE, and JVM \u2014 The Trinity of Execution \u00b6 At this point it\u2019s worth separating the pieces you install and run: The JVM is the core engine that executes bytecode. The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) packages the JVM with standard libraries and runtime support \u2014 enough to run Java applications. The JDK (Java Development Kit) includes everything in the JRE plus compilers ( javac ), debugging tools, and build utilities \u2014 enough to develop applications. So: Users of Java programs need the JRE . Developers of Java programs need the JDK . Both rely on the JVM , which is where the bytecode lives and breathes. They form a nested hierarchy: JDK = JRE + compiler + tools JRE = JVM + standard libraries 8. Spring \u2014 Reflection Turned Into Engineering \u00b6 Everything that Spring does \u2014 dependency injection, configuration, AOP \u2014 rests on reflection and classloading. When you start a Spring application, it performs a grand act of introspection : It scans the classpath , asking ClassLoaders to enumerate every .class file available. It uses reflection to inspect those classes for specific annotations: @Component , @Service , @Controller , @Configuration . It constructs an internal registry (the ApplicationContext ) that maps out all known classes and their dependencies. It instantiates those classes dynamically using reflection, often injecting one into another using constructor or field injection. It sometimes wraps them in proxies \u2014 dynamic subclasses or interfaces that intercept method calls to provide extra behavior (like transaction management or logging). Every piece of this process \u2014 scanning, loading, wiring \u2014 depends on the JVM\u2019s built-in meta-system. Spring is not magic; it\u2019s a disciplined orchestration of classloaders, metadata, and reflection. It turns static code into a living, configurable organism . 9. The Whole Flow \u2014 From Code to Context \u00b6 Here\u2019s the conceptual journey in one unbroken line: You write .java source files. javac compiles them into .class bytecode. ClassLoaders pull that bytecode into the JVM and store class metadata in Metaspace. The JVM uses those blueprints to create objects on the heap. Reflection allows runtime access and modification of those blueprints. Spring leverages reflection to wire up and manage those objects automatically. The entire stack \u2014 from low-level memory regions to high-level frameworks \u2014 is one continuous spectrum. The heap is the living matter. Metaspace is the genetic code. ClassLoaders are the reproduction system. Reflection is the consciousness. Spring is the civilization that emerges on top. 10. Why It Matters \u00b6 Understanding this chain transforms how you read errors, optimize performance, and design systems. When you see a ClassNotFoundException , you know it\u2019s a ClassLoader problem . When you hit OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace , you know it\u2019s a class metadata leak , not a heap issue. When you step into a Spring bean and see it\u2019s a proxy class, you can trace the reflection trail back to the original. At its best, Java is not just a language \u2014 it\u2019s a small self-contained universe. Its runtime introspection gives it a quality rarely found in compiled languages: the ability to evolve itself at runtime. That\u2019s what makes Spring, Hibernate, and every major framework possible.","title":"Java Runtime & Reflection"},{"location":"concepts/languages/java/core/00-java-runtime-and-reflection/#java-runtime-reflection-quick-starter","text":"A guided chain from JVM internals \u2192 runtime behavior \u2192 reflection \u2192 Spring magic .","title":"\u2699\ufe0f Java Runtime &amp; Reflection \u2014 Quick Starter"},{"location":"concepts/languages/java/core/00-java-runtime-and-reflection/#1-jvm-the-beating-heart-of-java","text":"The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the engine that runs your compiled Java code.

Metaspace: where class metadata ( Class<?> ) is stored. Stack: where temporary references and method calls are tracked per thread. So far so good. Now \u2014 where does the \u201cString pool\u201d live in all this? 2\ufe0f\u20e3 The String Pool \u2014 a Special Corner of the Heap \u00b6 When you write: String s1 = \"Hello\" ; String s2 = \"Hello\" ; you don\u2019t get two String objects. Both s1 and s2 point to the same one. That\u2019s because of the String pool \u2014 a cache of unique string literals maintained by the JVM inside the heap (specifically in a small internal structure sometimes called the interned string table ). \ud83e\udde0 Why it exists \u00b6 Strings are everywhere in code \u2014 class names, annotations, log messages, JSON keys. If every identical literal created a new object, memory would explode. The pool ensures that identical string literals share one object . \ud83d\udd27 How it works \u00b6 When the JVM loads a class from bytecode, it parses constant values (including string literals). For every \"Hello\" literal, it checks a hidden table in the heap. If \"Hello\" exists already \u2192 reuse the same object. If not \u2192 create it once and store it in that table. That table is called the string intern pool . \ud83e\udde9 Visual idea \u00b6 Heap \u251c\u2500\u2500 String Pool \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \"Hello\" \u2190 shared \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \"World\" \u2190 shared \u251c\u2500\u2500 Other Objects \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 new User() \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 new ArrayList() Both String a = \"Hello\" ; String b = \"Hello\" ; point to the same \"Hello\" inside the pool. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 How it connects to Objects and Classes \u00b6 Concept Description Where it lives String object an instance of java.lang.String Heap \"literal\" loaded and pooled at class loading Heap (string pool) String.class the blueprint of all String objects Metaspace ClassLoader loads java.lang.String at startup Bootstrap classloader String s = \"abc\"; references a pooled String Heap (shared entry) new String(\"abc\") explicitly makes a new object Heap (outside the pool) So, String behaves like any other Object , but it\u2019s interned \u2014 meaning the JVM manages a special table of \u201cknown identical values.\u201d 4\ufe0f\u20e3 The role of intern() \u00b6 You can manually play with the pool: String a = new String ( \"Hello\" ); String b = a . intern (); System . out . println ( a == b ); // false (a is new) System . out . println ( b == \"Hello\" ); // true (pooled) new String(\"Hello\") \u2192 creates a brand-new object on the heap, outside the pool. a.intern() \u2192 checks the pool: if \"Hello\" exists \u2192 return reference to that pooled one, otherwise add it and return it. So intern() bridges your runtime-created strings back into the shared pool. 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Historical context \u2014 PermGen vs Metaspace \u00b6 Before Java 8, the string pool lived in PermGen (an older memory area used for class metadata). This caused frequent OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space issues when too many strings were interned. In Java 8+, the pool was moved to the heap , and PermGen was replaced by Metaspace , which stores class metadata ( Class<?> objects). That\u2019s why today: Strings \u2192 Heap Class<?> \u2192 Metaspace Different worlds, but both part of the JVM runtime memory. 6\ufe0f\u20e3 Relation to Class Loaders \u00b6 When a class is loaded, all its string literals are loaded along with it. So the ClassLoader that loads your class also triggers the JVM to register its string constants into the pool. Example: public class Demo { private static final String GREETING = \"Hello\" ; } When Demo.class is loaded: The ClassLoader parses bytecode constants. Finds \"Hello\" \u2192 checks the string pool. Interns it (adds to the shared table if not already there). That\u2019s why string literals get pooled automatically at class load time. 7\ufe0f\u20e3 Putting it all together \u2014 unified model \u00b6 JVM MEMORY MAP +------------------------------------------------------------+ | JVM Memory | |------------------------------------------------------------| | Heap | | \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 | | \u2502 Object Instances (new User(), new ArrayList(), ...) \u2502 | | \u2502 String Pool: \"Hello\", \"World\", \"abc\", ...

When they stay in their lane, systems stay clean and your brain stays sane. Controllers \u00b6 The bouncers of the API club. They accept requests, attach @Valid DTOs, and hand off to services.

Repositories are boring on purpose. You want boring persistence. @Entity public class Product { @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id ; @Column ( nullable = false , unique = true ) String sku ; Instant createdAt ; @PrePersist void init (){ ... } } JpaRepository gives CRUD, plus custom finders ( findBySku() ). Entity rules : \u2022 DB constraints: nullability, lengths, indexes \u2022 no request validation annotations \u2022 lifecycle hooks allowed \u2022 avoid polluting with presentation logic Mappers \u00b6 Little translators.

They contain persistence-related fields, relationships, and DB constraints. Entities evolve according to internal data needs and should not be exposed directly to clients. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) represent API input and output models and are managed by validation + JSON serialization tools (e.g., Jackson).

If you only clean at the REST endpoint , dirt can still enter from other doors: CLI scripts, batch jobs, Kafka consumers, test fixtures, even JPA reads/writes. That leads to: Broken uniqueness checks (\u201cBooks \u201d vs \u201cBooks\u201d). Inconsistent comparisons (NFD vs NFC). User-visible glitches (\u201cinvisible space\u201d bugs). Data you can\u2019t reliably query. So you need two guardrails with one source of truth . Two guardrails, one truth \u00b6 Guardrail 1 \u2014 Endpoint layer (UX + consistency at the edge) \u00b6 Purpose: make incoming JSON sane and give clients friendly errors. Normalize on deserialization : a global Jackson @JsonComponent that runs Text.normalize(String) on every @RequestBody String . Add @Raw to skip sensitive fields (passwords/tokens). Validate DTOs : @Valid + @NotBlank , @Size , etc. Validation now runs on the cleaned text, so messages and limits are correct. Map to domain : use MapStruct (optional) to avoid boilerplate. Outcome: clients get predictable 400s; your services see already-clean strings. Guardrail 2 \u2014 Internal/domain layer (ironclad invariants) \u00b6 Purpose: protect all entry points (REST, CLI, Kafka, tests). Promote \u201chot\u201d string concepts to Value Objects (VOs) : EmailAddress , Slug , maybe NormalizedName . Their .of(raw) does the same Text.normalize(...) and enforces rules. Make services accept typed commands/VOs , not raw strings. If a caller tries to pass junk, the VO constructor explodes before data enters the core. Optional last mile: @PrePersist/@PreUpdate or JPA AttributeConverter for VOs to keep DB round-trips canonical. Outcome: even non-HTTP code can\u2019t inject dirt. One source of truth: Text.normalize(...) is used by both the endpoint (via Jackson) and the VO constructors. Change it once \u2192 the whole app adapts. What\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d for practice vs production? \u00b6 For practice / portfolio (ship fast, don\u2019t drown) \u00b6 Use DTOs with Bean Validation at endpoints. Add a tiny sanitizer utility Text.normalize(String) and call it in the service for key fields you compare/query (e.g., name before existsByName ). Create a DB unique index on the canonical form (e.g., lower(name) ). This is perfectly fine while you learn and build features. For production / long-lived systems (go full) \u00b6 Endpoint: global Jackson String normalizer (+ @Raw escapes), DTO validation. Domain: VOs for invariant concepts; services accept VOs (or commands composed of VOs). Mapping: MapStruct type-based converters to route String \u2192 VO everywhere without repetition. Persistence: DB unique indexes (e.g., lower(name) ), matching column lengths. Optional safety nets: @PrePersist/@PreUpdate per entity or AttributeConverter per VO. What NOT to do (pain generators) \u00b6 Don\u2019t rely only on @PrePersist/@PreUpdate : too late for validation and equality/uniqueness checks. Don\u2019t sprinkle normalize() in every constructor : easy to miss paths, bad errors, duplication. Don\u2019t create a VO per entity field ( CategoryEmail , UserEmail \u2026) \u2014 create a VO per concept ( EmailAddress ) and reuse it. Minimal code you can reuse \u00b6 1) Normalizer (one truth): public final class Text { private Text () {} public static String normalize ( String s ) { if ( s == null ) return null ; String t = s . trim () . replace ( \"\\u200B\" , \"\" ). replace ( \"\\u200C\" , \"\" ). replace ( \"\\u200D\" , \"\" ); return java . text . Normalizer . normalize ( t , java . text . Normalizer . Form . NFC ); } } 2) Endpoint guard (global JSON normalizer + opt-out): Jackson @JsonComponent String deserializer \u2192 runs Text.normalize for all @RequestBody strings. @Raw annotation to skip sensitive fields (passwords, signatures, base64). 3) Domain VOs (pick only the concepts that matter): public record EmailAddress ( String value ) { public static EmailAddress of ( String raw ) { var c = Text . normalize ( raw ); if ( c == null || ! c . matches ( \"^[^@\\\\s]+@[^@\\\\s]+\\\\.[^@\\\\s]+$\" )) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( \"Invalid email\" ); return new EmailAddress ( c ); } } public record Slug ( String value ) { public static Slug of ( String raw ) { var c = Text . normalize ( raw ). toLowerCase () . replaceAll ( \"[^a-z0-9-]+\" , \"-\" ). replaceAll ( \"^-+|-+$\" , \"\" ); if ( c . isBlank () || c . length () > 80 ) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( \"Invalid slug\" ); return new Slug ( c ); } } 4) Service signatures take typed inputs (internal guard): public record CreateCategory ( Slug slug , EmailAddress ownerEmail , String description ) {} @Service class CategoryService { public Category create ( CreateCategory cmd ) { /* cmd fields already canonical */ } } 5) DB guard: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_category_name_ci ON category ( lower ( name )); -- Match VARCHAR lengths to your DTO/VO limits. Decision rules (fast heuristics) \u00b6 Is this field free-text (description, notes)? Normalize at endpoint only. Keep it a String . Don\u2019t over-constrain. Will this field be compared, deduped, or displayed in canonical form (email, slug, code)? Make a VO for it. Services consume the VO. Add a DB index on a canonical expression. Prototype vs hardening: Start with service-level normalize for key fields \u2192 later flip on global Jackson normalizer and introduce VOs where rules matter. No breaking API changes. The elevator pitch you can put in your vault \u00b6 Two gates, one truth. Normalize at the edge for UX and consistent validation. Enforce invariants in the domain with reusable value objects so every caller\u2014REST, CLI, Kafka\u2014must pass through the same rules. Start with endpoint-only while learning; go full pipeline for production. Back it with DB constraints to catch races. Next steps to lock it in \u00b6 Add Text.normalize(...) . Add global Jackson String normalizer + @Raw . Keep DTO validation. Add a unique index on canonical name/slug in SQL. When a field\u2019s rules start to matter across the system, promote it to a VO and switch your service signature to accept that VO.

You write rules like: public record CreateUserRequest ( @NotBlank @Email String email , @NotBlank String name , @Size ( min = 8 ) String password ) {} And your framework goes: \u201cAlright, if someone tries to POST a user without an email or with a cat-length password, we refuse politely.\u201d It\u2019s declarative validation. You\u2019re describing rules. You\u2019re not writing if (email == null || email.isBlank()) throw new ... . That saves you from \u201cspaghetti validation hell\u201d \u2014 those ugly forests of if s that creep into beginner service layers. Why does it exist? \u00b6 Historically, developers scattered validation logic all over: UI input checks Controller checks Service layer checks Database constraints Each spot duplicated the same rules. Boredom, bugs, sadness. Jakarta Validation centralizes rules so you can: Declare once, validate everywhere Keep your business code focused on business logic, not guarding doors Get consistent error format for bad input Plug in custom validators when life gets fancy The universe likes DRY code; this is a tool aligned with entropy reduction. How does Spring hook into it? \u00b6 Spring uses Hibernate Validator under the hood to implement the Jakarta spec. When you put @Valid in your controller method, you're saying: \"Framework, inspect this object, and if it doesn't meet expectations, toss a polite tantrum.\" Example: @PostMapping ( \"/users\" ) public ResponseEntity < UserResponse > createUser ( @Valid @RequestBody CreateUserRequest req ) { ... } When validation fails, Spring throws MethodArgumentNotValidException . If you have a global exception handler, you translate that into your structured API error. Without one, Spring returns its default JSON scolding. Common constraints you\u2019ll see \u00b6 Human-memory-friendly version first, so your brain absorbs the essence: @NotNull \u2014 must exist @NotBlank \u2014 must contain non-space characters @Email \u2014 must smell like an email @Size(min, max) \u2014 good for strings & collections @Min / @Max \u2014 number guardians @Pattern \u2014 regex wizardry @Past / @Future \u2014 great for dates (birthday in the future? you\u2019re time-traveling or lying) Mechanical versions, if your cortex enjoys officiality: @NotNull @NotBlank @NotEmpty @Email @Size ( min = 3 , max = 255 ) @Min ( 1 ) @Max ( 100 ) @Positive @Negative @PositiveOrZero @Pattern ( regexp = \"regex here\" ) @Past @PastOrPresent @Future @FutureOrPresent You will forget @NotEmpty exists because @NotBlank is nicer for text. This is fine. The world continues spinning. Beyond simple annotations: custom validators \u00b6 Sometimes reality is annoying, like validating: Password strength (uppercase, digit, symbol\u2026) \"End date must be after start date\" \"Username cannot contain the word 'bot'\" \"VAT number valid for EU country\" You create annotation + validator: @Target ({ FIELD }) @Retention ( RUNTIME ) @Constraint ( validatedBy = StrongPasswordValidator . class ) public @interface StrongPassword { String message () default \"Weak password\" ; Class <?>[] groups () default {}; Class <? extends Payload >[] payload () default {}; } Implement logic: public class StrongPasswordValidator implements ConstraintValidator < StrongPassword , String > { public boolean isValid ( String value , ConstraintValidatorContext ctx ) { return value != null && value . matches ( \".*[A-Z].*\" ) && value . matches ( \".*\\\\d.*\" ) && value . length () >= 8 ; } } These become reusable, clean, and readable. Just don't get too validator-happy and try encoding your whole business logic there. Validators are for input sanity , not domain decisions . Where validation belongs in the grand architecture story? \u00b6 Quick conceptual map: DTO / Request layer \u2192 use Jakarta Validation (describing shape of input ) Domain layer \u2192 enforce invariants (business rules) DB \u2192 final sanity gates (e.g., unique constraints) Think of it like concentric shields: client input \u2192 request validation \u2192 domain invariants \u2192 database constraints Validation does not replace business rules. Your domain still says things like: \"User must be at least 18 to register.\" Validation only says: \"Age field must be present and a number.\" Future-proof note: javax.validation vs jakarta.validation \u00b6 Modern apps = jakarta.validation . Old tutorials may still show javax.* . Same concept, just a namespace shift when Java EE moved to Eclipse Foundation. If your IDE screams mismatched imports, it's not angry; it's reminding you time moves forward. Quick example end-to-end \u00b6 Request DTO: public record CreateProductRequest ( @NotBlank String name , @Min ( 1 ) int quantity , @Positive double price ) {} Controller: @PostMapping public ResponseEntity < ProductResponse > create ( @Valid @RequestBody CreateProductRequest req ) { var result = service . create ( req ); return ResponseEntity . ok ( result ); } If validation fails, your global handler formats it to ProblemDetail or your flavor of JSON errors. Clean, predictable, civilized. Mental model to carry \u00b6 Jakarta Validation is not a silver bullet. It\u2019s a first line of defense, not your whole army. It keeps nonsense out, but meaning is enforced by your business logic. Same way a gym membership won't make you fit \u2014 but it definitely helps. Where to explore next \u00b6 Once you\u2019re comfortable with validation, interesting paths branch out: ProblemDetail + error catalog patterns Constraint composition ( @ValidAge @ValidName ) Validation groups (e.g. different rules for CREATE vs UPDATE) Record DTOs vs JavaBeans Fluent error reporting patterns Domain invariants vs input validation boundaries Validation is just the first guard tower.

Much cleaner. Much more \u201centerprise samurai\u201d. The dark arts \u2014 when validation goes wrong \u00b6 Truth time: validation can become a trap if abused. Smells to watch for: 1. Validators querying the database Using repository inside validator = slow, brittle, and merges layers wrongly. Flag it immediately. Put uniqueness checks in services. 2. Over-validating Example: enforcing domain business rules inside DTOs. Input validation should describe shape , not policy . 3. Reusing the same DTO everywhere Common rookie move: They use UserDto for create, update, API response, internal logic. Eventually it gains 30 fields and 20 annotations and becomes a Lovecraftian monster. Solution: separate DTOs by intent, not ego. Spring\u2019s validation pipeline \u2014 what happens under the hood \u00b6 When you do: public ResponseEntity <?> create ( @Valid @RequestBody UserInput req ) Flow looks like: JSON gets deserialized Spring detects @Valid Hibernate Validator runs constraints If violations found \u2192 throws MethodArgumentNotValidException Your @RestControllerAdvice catches and formats it Controller logic runs only if clean Important realization: Bad input never reaches your service (if you architect correctly). That\u2019s not just safety \u2014 it\u2019s clarity. Your core logic wakes up only for sane requests. Error messages \u2014 human dignity matters \u00b6 Try this: @NotBlank ( message = \"Name is required\" ) String name ; instead of: @NotBlank ( message = \"must not be blank\" ) One talks to a machine. The other talks to a person. Good API designers think about tone \u2014 even in errors. i18n \u2014 multilingual validations \u00b6 You can externalize messages into messages.properties : user.name.notBlank=Name is required. In annotation: @NotBlank ( message = \"{user.name.notBlank}\" ) String name ; This becomes priceless if your client base includes people who speak more than one language or one developer in Brazil and another in Lithuania (wink). Order matters \u2014 validation sequence \u00b6 Jakarta lets you enforce validation order: first check null then pattern then domain logic You define groups and sequence: @GroupSequence ({ Step1 . class , Step2 . class , Step3 . class }) public interface ValidationOrder {} Rarely used early in career but deeply helpful in real multi-step workflows. Immutable DTOs vs validation \u2014 an interesting tension \u00b6 Java records are clean and immutable-ish. Validation framework expects mutable bean style? Not exactly \u2014 it works fine. But two patterns emerge: Constructor normalization (good): public record UserRequest ( @NotBlank String name ) { public UserRequest { name = name . trim (); } } Mutating after validation (bad): req . setName ( req . getName (). trim ()); Try not to mutate validated data. Feed it forward as-is or revalidate. Immutability + validation = happy data pipeline. You don't validate everything \u00b6 Say your system generates timestamps internally. Do you put @PastOrPresent on them? No. You trust your system. Validation gates untrusted input from outside your core. Inside? You enforce rules via code and domain objects. That separation is elegance. Security \u2014 the silent twin \u00b6 Validation \u2260 security. But validation feeds security.

If I put it on method parameters will it work?\u201d \u00b6 Yes, it works on method parameters (and return values), not just fields. There are two validation paths in Spring: A) MVC/Jackson path (controllers) When you do @Valid @RequestBody Dto dto , Spring MVC automatically runs bean validation on the deserialized DTO before your controller code executes. B) Method validation (any Spring bean: services, schedulers, Kafka listeners, etc.) To validate method parameters and return values on any Spring bean, add @Validated on the class (or method). Then put constraints directly on parameters and/or @Valid on complex types. import jakarta.validation.Valid ; import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull ; import jakarta.validation.constraints.Positive ; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service ; import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated ; @Validated @Service public class UserService { // Parameter constraints work because the class is @Validated public User create ( @Valid CreateUserCommand cmd ) { \u2026 } public User getById ( @Positive long id ) { \u2026 } // You can validate the return value too public @Valid UserDto find ( @NotNull String email ) { \u2026 } } How it works: @Validated switches on Spring\u2019s method validation AOP . Spring intercepts calls to that bean and runs Jakarta Validation on parameters/return values. Without @Validated , parameter annotations in services are ignored. You can also validate programmatically anywhere: @Autowired Validator validator ; var violations = validator . validate ( obj ); if ( ! violations . isEmpty ()) { /* translate to error */ } 2) \u201cOther sources like Kafka\u2014do they use DTOs too? Same validations? Double-checking?\u201d \u00b6 Think in boundaries . Every external input path (HTTP, Kafka, gRPC, batch CSV, GraphQL) is a boundary. At each boundary: You\u2019ll have a message/DTO type for that channel. You should validate it at the boundary before it touches your domain/services. Examples: HTTP (controller) @Valid @RequestBody CreateUserRequest req Kafka (listener bean) Put @Validated on the listener class, then: @Validated @Component class UserEventsListener { @KafkaListener ( topics = \"users.create\" ) public void handle ( @Valid UserCreatedEvent event ) { // safe to use 'event' here } // collections? validate elements: @KafkaListener ( topics = \"users.batch\" ) public void handleBatch ( @Valid List < @Valid UserCreatedEvent > events ) { \u2026 } } Schema angle: In Kafka you often use Avro/Protobuf with a schema registry. That catches structural issues at deserialization time. Jakarta Validation then adds business-shape rules ( @NotBlank , @Pattern , @Size , etc.). They complement each other. Should you reuse the same DTOs across channels? You can , but it\u2019s usually healthier to keep channel-specific DTOs even if they look similar. HTTP shape and Kafka event shape tend to diverge over time (headers, metadata, batching, evolvability). Keep them separate and map into internal commands (the objects your service actually consumes). That keeps coupling low. Is this \u201cdouble validation\u201d? Do not duplicate Jakarta constraints across layers. Follow this rule: Validate at the boundary (controller, listener, batch reader) \u2192 Jakarta Validation.

Performance: Every validation run hits the DB (sometimes multiple times). Race conditions: You can pass the \u201cunique\u201d check but still lose to a concurrent insert.

It\u2019s a story about how Java evolved from \u201cdo everything yourself\u201d to \u201clet the framework orchestrate the show.\u201d Spring sits in that shift \u2014 teaching code to manage itself. 1. The Old Days \u2014 Manual Wiring \u00b6 In plain Java, you were the conductor of a one-person orchestra. UserService user = new UserService (); PaymentService pay = new PaymentService ( user ); OrderService order = new OrderService ( pay ); You wrote new everywhere. You knew every connection by hand. That works until your system grows and suddenly: Changing one class breaks five others. You can\u2019t test one piece without booting everything. You have no central place that knows what depends on what . Developers started dreaming of a container \u2014 something that could build and connect objects automatically. That dream became Spring . 2. Reflection \u2014 Letting Code Look at Code \u00b6 Java has a secret mirror called reflection . It lets a program peek into its own classes while running: \u201cWhat fields does this class have?\u201d \u201cDoes it have an annotation called @Component ?\u201d \u201cCan I call this method without knowing its name at compile time?\u201d Spring uses that mirror to discover and build your objects. When you run your app, it quietly scans every class on your classpath. When it finds one marked like this: @Component public class PaymentService {} It says: Ah, that\u2019s mine to manage. Then it creates an instance reflectively \u2014 without you writing new PaymentService() . That\u2019s where the magic begins: the framework starts taking responsibility for creation . 3. Beans \u2014 Living Java Objects \u00b6 Spring calls these managed objects beans . They\u2019re still just Java objects, but with a difference \u2014 Spring controls their entire life . A bean is born when the container starts. It\u2019s injected with whatever it needs. It lives inside a structure called the ApplicationContext , and when the application shuts down, Spring cleans it up. You can think of the ApplicationContext as a living ecosystem of beans : ApplicationContext \u251c\u2500 auditService \u251c\u2500 paymentService \u2514\u2500 userService Each one can depend on the others \u2014 but they never create each other directly. They trust Spring to connect them. 4. Dependency Injection \u2014 Letting Someone Else Plug the Cables \u00b6 In normal Java, a class builds its own tools. With Spring, it simply says what it needs , and the container provides it. That pattern is called Dependency Injection (DI). Imagine a workshop: Without Spring: every worker buys their own hammer. With Spring: there\u2019s a tool manager handing out hammers as needed. In code: @Service public class PaymentService { private final AuditService audit ; public PaymentService ( AuditService audit ) { this . audit = audit ; } } You don\u2019t decide which AuditService to use. Spring does. At startup, it looks at your constructor and says: \u201cI have an AuditService bean \u2014 I\u2019ll plug it in.\u201d That\u2019s constructor injection \u2014 the cleanest and safest style. Spring can also inject dependencies through setters or directly into fields, but constructor injection makes dependencies explicit, like stating ingredients on a recipe. 5. Inversion of Control \u2014 The Big Flip \u00b6 Before Spring, you wrote code like this: PaymentService pay = new PaymentService ( new AuditService ()); You were in charge of when and how things were created. Spring flips that \u2014 hence the phrase Inversion of Control (IoC) . Now, you declare what your classes need, and the framework decides when to create, connect, and destroy them . You stopped being the factory. You became the designer \u2014 telling the system what components exist and how they should relate. Spring became the conductor of your orchestra. 6. The ApplicationContext \u2014 Spring\u2019s Brain \u00b6 The ApplicationContext is Spring\u2019s central nervous system. When you run a Spring Boot app with: SpringApplication . run ( App . class , args ); you\u2019re really saying: \u201cHey Spring, build my world.\u201d Here\u2019s roughly what happens: Spring creates the ApplicationContext. It scans your classpath for components ( @Component , @Service , @Repository \u2026). It builds a list of BeanDefinitions \u2014 recipes describing how to create each bean. It uses reflection to instantiate them. It injects dependencies. It calls initialization hooks ( @PostConstruct ). Finally, it announces: \u201cContext refreshed \u2014 everything\u2019s alive.\u201d From this point on, you can request any bean, and Spring will hand you a fully wired instance. 7. Bean Lifecycle \u2014 The Circle of (Application) Life \u00b6 Every bean in Spring goes through predictable stages: 1. Definition \u2192 Spring learns about the class 2. Instantiation \u2192 Object is created reflectively 3. Dependency Injection \u2192 Fields/constructors are filled 4. Initialization \u2192 @PostConstruct runs 5. Ready State \u2192 Bean is active and serving 6. Destruction \u2192 @PreDestroy runs at shutdown This is why your app can start, serve, and shut down gracefully. Spring takes care of object lifespans so you can focus on behavior. 8. Why This Architecture Matters \u00b6 This container-based system unlocks a few superpowers: Loose coupling \u2014 classes don\u2019t depend on each other directly. Configurable behavior \u2014 you can change how things work via annotations or properties. Automatic lifecycle management \u2014 no manual setup or cleanup. Testability \u2014 you can inject mocks for testing instead of real beans. Once you experience it, going back to plain new feels like riding a horse after owning a spaceship. 9. AOP \u2014 Teaching Beans New Tricks \u00b6 When Spring controls your objects, it can extend their behavior . That\u2019s where Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) comes in. Think of AOP as a transparent wrapper around your beans. When someone calls a method, Spring can sneak in extra logic before or after it \u2014 like logging, transactions, or caching \u2014 without changing the original class. @Service public class PaymentService { @Transactional public void pay () { ... } } When you call pay() , you\u2019re actually calling a proxy , not the raw object. That proxy: Opens a transaction, Calls your method, Commits or rolls back depending on the result. Same story for @Async , @Cacheable , or @Secured \u2014 all powered by this wrapping trick. That\u2019s how crosscutting concerns stay separate from business logic. 10. How Spring Pulls It Off \u00b6 Behind the scenes: Reflection lets Spring look at classes and create them dynamically. IoC gives Spring control over who creates what. AOP gives Spring control over how methods behave when called. Together, they form a vertical architecture: Reflection \u2192 builds beans \u2193 IoC \u2192 manages relationships and lifecycles \u2193 AOP \u2192 adds behavior at runtime Each layer adds a dimension: first existence, then orchestration, then influence. 11. The Philosophy in One Line \u00b6 Spring\u2019s goal is to let developers think about \u201cwhat should happen,\u201d not \u201chow to glue it all together.\u201d It doesn\u2019t replace Java \u2014 it elevates it, turning plain classes into cooperative citizens inside a managed world. 12. The Lifecycle of a Spring Application \u00b6 You press Run . Spring starts and scans your classes. It builds a map of all components. It reflectively creates and connects them. It wraps some in proxies for AOP. It publishes \u201cContext Refreshed\u201d \u2014 your app is alive. When you stop, it calls cleanup hooks and shuts down gracefully. That\u2019s the entire story \u2014 an ecosystem built from reflection, orchestration, and trust. 13. TL;DR Summary \u00b6 Concept What It Means Why It Matters Reflection Java looking at itself Lets Spring find and create your beans Bean A managed Java object Gives you lifecycle control Dependency Injection Framework provides dependencies Removes manual wiring Inversion of Control (IoC) Framework owns object creation Makes systems modular ApplicationContext Container managing beans Central brain of your app AOP / Proxies Logic woven around methods Adds features like transactions, caching \ud83e\ude9e Final Thought \u00b6 Spring isn\u2019t a library you call \u2014 it\u2019s an environment you live in. It doesn\u2019t just execute code; it hosts it. Once you understand that, every @Autowired , every @Transactional , every line of your app fits into one graceful rhythm: discover, build, wire, run, extend, and clean up.","title":"Quickstart to Spring Core"},{"location":"concepts/languages/java/spring/core/03-quickstart/#spring-core-a-gentle-but-complete-story","text":"Purpose: This isn\u2019t a list of annotations.

It\u2019s a living object with metadata, behavior, and reflective wrapping. \ud83c\udf31 The Mental Model \u00b6 A bean in Spring is to the container what a cell is to an organism: it has a definition (DNA) , a lifecycle (birth \u2192 death) , and a membrane (proxy) that controls how it interacts with the outside world. \ud83e\uddec 1. Bean Definition \u2014 the DNA \u00b6 Before a bean exists, Spring builds a BeanDefinition \u2014 metadata describing how to create it. @Component \u2192 scanned @Bean \u2192 declared XML \u2192 defined Each definition contains: Field Description beanClass The Class<?> object of the bean scope \"singleton\" , \"prototype\" , \"request\" , etc. dependencies Other beans to inject initMethod , destroyMethod Lifecycle callbacks lazyInit Whether to delay creation until needed primary , qualifiers Conflict resolution hints The BeanDefinition lives in memory long before any object is created. \u2699\ufe0f 2. Instantiation \u2014 the Birth \u00b6 When the context is refreshed, Spring instantiates the bean via reflection : Object bean = beanClass . getDeclaredConstructor (). newInstance (); Then it resolves all declared dependencies ( @Autowired , constructor args, etc.). At this point: The object exists. Dependencies are injected. Lifecycle callbacks haven\u2019t yet run. This is the infant bean stage. \ud83e\udde9 3. Initialization \u2014 Becoming Alive \u00b6 Spring then applies post-processing and lifecycle interfaces : Mechanism Trigger Purpose @PostConstruct Annotation Custom setup logic InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet() Interface Legacy init hook init-method XML config Alternative init BeanPostProcessor Global interceptors Modify/replace beans after creation For example, a post-processor might wrap a bean in a proxy to add behavior ( @Transactional , @Async , etc.). After initialization, the bean is fully active \u2014 ready to be used or injected elsewhere. \ud83e\ude9e 4. Proxies \u2014 The Membrane \u00b6 A proxy is a thin reflective wrapper around your bean. It intercepts method calls to add extra logic like transactions, security, or async execution. Two main types: \u00b6 Type Tool Used For JDK Dynamic Proxy Java\u2019s Proxy API Interfaces only CGLIB Proxy Bytecode subclass Concrete classes Example: @Transactional public class PaymentService { ... } Spring replaces it at runtime with something like: PaymentService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$abc123 When you call a method, the proxy runs code before and after your logic (start transaction \u2192 invoke target \u2192 commit/rollback). \ud83e\udded 5. Scopes \u2014 The Lifecycle Context \u00b6 A bean\u2019s scope defines how long it lives and where it\u2019s shared : Scope Description singleton One shared instance per context (default) prototype New instance every injection request One per HTTP request (web only) session One per HTTP session application One per servlet context websocket One per WebSocket session Example: @Scope ( \"prototype\" ) @Component public class TaskProcessor { ... } @Autowired of a prototype bean creates a fresh instance each time. \ud83e\udde9 6. Awareness Interfaces \u2014 Talking to the Container \u00b6 Some beans want to \u201cknow\u201d about their environment. Spring injects this information through special Aware interfaces : Interface What you get ApplicationContextAware Access to the context BeanNameAware The name assigned to your bean EnvironmentAware Config and property access ResourceLoaderAware File/resource utilities These aren\u2019t common for business logic, but essential for infrastructure beans (framework internals, logging, plugin systems). \ud83c\udf07 7. Destruction \u2014 Graceful Death \u00b6 At shutdown or when the context closes: Mechanism When @PreDestroy Before bean destruction DisposableBean.destroy() Legacy cleanup destroy-method XML config ContextClosedEvent Published globally Spring calls these hooks reflectively to release connections, threads, caches, etc. \ud83e\udde9 8. The Full Lifecycle Map \u00b6 1. Scan classes \u2192 build BeanDefinition 2. Instantiate \u2192 inject dependencies 3. Apply BeanPostProcessors 4. Call @PostConstruct / init-method 5.

Context shutdown \u2192 call @PreDestroy \u26a1 Putting it Together \u2014 Reflection\u2019s Thread \u00b6 Reflection appears at every layer: Definition stage: reads annotations ( Class.isAnnotationPresent ) Instantiation stage: calls constructors Injection stage: sets fields or methods Initialization stage: invokes annotated methods Proxying stage: intercepts via dynamic subclasses Yet once the bean is active, reflection disappears \u2014 normal method calls dominate. \ud83e\udded TL;DR Summary \u00b6 Aspect Description Driven by Reflection?

It\u2019s the hands-on implementation of Inversion of Control (IoC). You don\u2019t \u201cnew\u201d dependencies \u2014 the container does , using reflection and metadata. \ud83e\udded Mental Model \u00b6 Traditional Java: public class PaymentService { private final AuditService audit = new AuditService (); } You control everything \u2014 creation, wiring, lifecycle. This is tight coupling . Spring-style DI: @Service public class PaymentService { private final AuditService audit ; public PaymentService ( AuditService audit ) { this . audit = audit ; } } Now Spring decides what instance of AuditService to inject. That\u2019s IoC in practice \u2014 you lose control of creation, gain flexibility and testability. \ud83e\uddec 1. Constructor Injection \u2014 Strong, Immutable, Recommended \u00b6 Dependencies are passed through the constructor. The bean is fully initialized at creation time \u2014 no mutable state afterward. @Service public class PaymentService { private final AuditService audit ; private final NotificationService notifier ; @Autowired public PaymentService ( AuditService audit , NotificationService notifier ) { this . audit = audit ; this . notifier = notifier ; } } \u2705 Pros \u00b6 Enforces immutability \u2014 all dependencies known upfront. Easy to test (just call constructor). Prevents circular dependencies (Spring detects them early). Works cleanly with final fields. \u26a0\ufe0f Cons \u00b6 Slightly verbose for many parameters. If there\u2019s a circular dependency, you must refactor (Spring can\u2019t resolve it automatically). \ud83e\udde0 Under the hood \u00b6 Spring reads constructor metadata using reflection. Chooses the \u201cprimary\u201d constructor (or one annotated with @Autowired ). Instantiates dependencies recursively, then calls the constructor reflectively. \ud83e\udde9 2. Setter Injection \u2014 Flexible, Mutable, Legacy-friendly \u00b6 Dependencies are provided after the object is created, through setter methods. @Service public class PaymentService { private AuditService audit ; @Autowired public void setAuditService ( AuditService audit ) { this . audit = audit ; } } \u2705 Pros \u00b6 Useful for optional dependencies (you can omit some setters). Plays nicely with legacy beans that have no constructor injection. Can rewire or modify dependency after creation (in rare cases). \u26a0\ufe0f Cons \u00b6 Mutable \u2192 less safe. Object might exist in half-initialized state if not all setters are called. Harder to enforce required dependencies. \ud83e\udde0 Reflection flow \u00b6 Spring creates instance via no-arg constructor. Finds all methods annotated with @Autowired . Invokes them reflectively with matching beans. \ud83e\ude9e 3. Field Injection \u2014 Shortcut, but Dangerous in Core Code \u00b6 Dependencies are injected directly into private fields using reflection. It\u2019s concise, but hides dependencies and complicates testing. @Service public class PaymentService { @Autowired private AuditService audit ; } \u2705 Pros \u00b6 Minimal boilerplate. Handy for prototypes, quick demos, or tests. \u26a0\ufe0f Cons \u00b6 Hidden dependencies \u2014 constructor doesn\u2019t reveal requirements. Harder to write unit tests (can\u2019t mock easily without reflection tools). No immutability guarantees. Can fail silently if @Autowired(required = false) is used carelessly. \ud83e\udde0 Reflection flow \u00b6 Spring sets field accessibility with setAccessible(true) and assigns value directly: field . set ( beanInstance , dependencyInstance ); * No constructor or setter involved. \ud83e\udde9 4. Qualifiers & Ambiguity Resolution \u00b6 When multiple beans of the same type exist, Spring must decide which one to inject. That\u2019s where qualifiers come in. @Service ( \"emailNotifier\" ) public class EmailNotificationService implements Notifier {} @Service ( \"smsNotifier\" ) public class SmsNotificationService implements Notifier {} @Service public class PaymentService { private final Notifier notifier ; public PaymentService ( @Qualifier ( \"emailNotifier\" ) Notifier notifier ) { this . notifier = notifier ; } } Other options: @Primary \u2014 marks default bean for a type. @Qualifier \u2014 explicitly selects one. @Profile \u2014 activates beans per environment profile. \u2699\ufe0f 5. Optional and Lazy Injection \u00b6 Technique Description @Autowired(required = false) Allows optional dependency; null if absent. Optional<T> Preferred over required=false , more explicit. @Lazy Injects a proxy; bean created only when first used. @Autowired @Lazy private ExpensiveService heavy ; At runtime, Spring injects a proxy , not the real bean. The target is created only when heavy is first called. \ud83e\udde9 6. When to Use Which \u00b6 Pattern Ideal Use Case Notes Constructor Mandatory dependencies; core business beans Clean, testable, immutable Setter Optional dependencies; legacy beans Useful when partial config is allowed Field Quick wiring; small demos or tests Avoid in production core logic \ud83e\udde0 7. How Reflection Powers All DI \u00b6 Regardless of style, Spring always: Retrieves the target Class<?> . Scans for @Autowired , @Qualifier , etc. Resolves bean dependencies recursively. Uses reflection to call: Constructor \u2192 newInstance(args) Setter \u2192 method.invoke(bean, dep) Field \u2192 field.set(bean, dep) That\u2019s how the DI patterns are unified internally \u2014 they\u2019re just different reflection entry points . \ud83e\udded 8. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Symptom Root Cause Fix NoSuchBeanDefinitionException Dependency type not found Add or scan the missing bean BeanCurrentlyInCreationException Circular constructor injection Refactor one side to setter injection NullPointerException on injected field Bean not in component scan path Adjust @ComponentScan or configuration Conflicting beans Multiple candidates Add @Qualifier or @Primary \ud83e\udde9 9. Conceptual Summary \u00b6 Layer What happens Reflection role BeanDefinition Dependencies recorded Reads annotations Instantiation Bean created Calls constructor Injection Dependencies wired Sets fields/methods Initialization Post-construct logic Invokes annotated methods \ud83e\ude9e TL;DR \u00b6 All DI patterns are just different \u201cdoors\u201d through which Spring enters your class. Constructor injection is the front door \u2014 safest and most explicit. Setter is the side door \u2014 flexible, but open to misuse. Field is the window \u2014 quick, but risky if overused. \ud83e\udde9 Core Takeaway \u00b6 Dependency Injection is how Spring performs Inversion of Control .

Apply post-processors and lifecycle hooks 6.

The Role of Reflection and Metadata \u00b6 Spring\u2019s IoC container is metadata-driven . It reads: Annotations like @Component , @Autowired , @Configuration , @Bean XML bean definitions Programmatic registrations Then, using reflection: Loads class definitions ( ClassLoader ) Instantiates via constructors Injects fields and methods Invokes lifecycle callbacks So IoC isn\u2019t runtime \u201cmagic\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a systematic use of reflection guided by metadata . \ud83e\ude9e 8. Benefits of IoC \u00b6 Benefit Explanation Decoupling Classes depend on interfaces, not implementations. Configurability Behavior changes via configuration, not code edits. Testability Dependencies can be replaced with mocks easily. Lifecycle management Framework ensures proper startup/shutdown. Extensibility Post-processors, events, and custom scopes are plug-ins, not hardcoded logic. \u26a1 9. Example \u2014 IoC in Action \u00b6 @Service public class OrderService { private final PaymentService payment ; private final InventoryService inventory ; @Autowired public OrderService ( PaymentService payment , InventoryService inventory ) { this . payment = payment ; this . inventory = inventory ; } public void placeOrder () { inventory . reserve (); payment . process (); } } At runtime: Spring finds all @Service classes.

It\u2019s how features like @Transactional , @Cacheable , or @Async work: Spring wraps your beans in proxies that intercept method calls and run extra logic before or after them. \ud83e\udde9 1. The Core Idea \u2014 Code that Crosses Boundaries \u00b6 Some logic doesn\u2019t belong to any one class \u2014 logging, security, transactions, caching, metrics. These are called crosscutting concerns . Without AOP: public class PaymentService { public void pay () { System . out . println ( \"Start transaction\" ); // business logic System . out . println ( \"Commit transaction\" ); } } With AOP: @Transactional public void pay () { // pure business logic } The container now weaves transaction management around your method automatically. \ud83e\udde0 2. Mental Model \u2014 Wrapping, Not Editing \u00b6 Think of AOP like a transparent shell wrapped around your bean: client \u2192 [Proxy wrapper] \u2192 [Your actual bean] The proxy: Intercepts the call. Runs extra logic before and/or after your method. Optionally changes arguments or return values. Delegates to your original bean. You keep writing pure business code; Spring handles the \u201cboring glue.\u201d \ud83e\udde9 3. AOP in Spring \u2014 How It\u2019s Implemented \u00b6 Spring AOP is proxy-based . It doesn\u2019t rewrite your bytecode (like AspectJ can). Instead, it dynamically builds a wrapper object at runtime. Two proxy types: \u00b6 Proxy Type Mechanism Used For JDK Dynamic Proxy java.lang.reflect.Proxy Beans that implement interfaces CGLIB Proxy Bytecode subclass (Enhancer) Concrete classes without interfaces Spring chooses automatically \u2014 JDK for interfaces, CGLIB for classes. Example of generated class: PaymentService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$123abc \u2699\ufe0f 4. AOP Terminology (Decoded Simply) \u00b6 Term Meaning Analogy Aspect A module of crosscutting logic A reusable lens applied to methods Advice The actual code run before/after/around a method The \u201cwhat\u201d in the lens Join Point A point in program execution (method call) The place where you can attach logic Pointcut A rule defining which join points to intercept The targeting scope Weaving The act of applying aspects to beans Putting the lens on Proxy The runtime wrapper performing interception The lens mount \ud83e\udde9 5. Example \u2014 Custom Aspect in Action \u00b6 @Aspect @Component public class LoggingAspect { @Before ( \"execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))\" ) public void logStart ( JoinPoint jp ) { System . out . println ( \"\u25b6 \" + jp . getSignature ()); } @AfterReturning ( pointcut = \"execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))\" , returning = \"result\" ) public void logEnd ( JoinPoint jp , Object result ) { System . out . println ( \"\u2714 \" + jp . getSignature () + \" returned \" + result ); } } When you call any method in com.app.service , Spring injects your LoggingAspect logic before and after the target method. \ud83e\udde9 6. The Lifecycle of an AOP Call \u00b6 Client \u2192 Proxy bean \u2193 Before advice (e.g., open transaction) \u2193 Target method invocation (your bean logic) \u2193 After/AfterReturning advice (e.g., commit) \u2193 Return result to caller This flow is executed inside the proxy , invisible to your code. \ud83e\udde9 7. Built-in AOP Use Cases in Spring \u00b6 Annotation Description Implemented Via @Transactional Begin/commit/rollback database transactions Proxy wrapping via TransactionInterceptor @Async Run method on separate thread Proxy executes in TaskExecutor @Cacheable Cache method results Proxy checks cache before invoking @Secured / @PreAuthorize Security access checks Proxy consults Spring Security interceptors @Retryable Automatic retry on failure Proxy repeats method calls Every one of these works by the same pattern: intercept \u2192 decide \u2192 invoke . \ud83e\uddec 8. Under the Hood \u2014 Reflection & IoC Working Together \u00b6 During context initialization, Spring detects @Aspect beans. Registers them via AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator . For every target bean: It checks if any aspect applies (based on pointcuts). If yes \u2014 creates a proxy bean wrapping the original. The proxy delegates all lifecycle management back to IoC. IoC builds the object graph; AOP wraps it. \ud83e\udded 9. Weaving Types \u2014 When It Happens \u00b6 Weaving Type When Used By Compile-time At .class generation AspectJ (not Spring) Load-time During class loading AspectJ LTW Runtime (proxy) During Spring context initialization Spring AOP Spring\u2019s choice of runtime weaving is deliberate \u2014 lightweight, portable, and configuration-free. \ud83e\udde9 10. Example of Proxy Structure (Simplified) \u00b6 Imagine you have: public interface PaymentService { void process (); } Spring creates something conceptually like: class PaymentServiceProxy implements PaymentService { private final PaymentService target ; private final TransactionManager txManager ; public void process () { txManager . begin (); try { target . process (); txManager . commit (); } catch ( Exception e ) { txManager . rollback (); throw e ; } } } This is what @Transactional really means. You get structured behavior \u2014 without changing the target code. \u26a1 11. Advantages of AOP \u00b6 Benefit Description Separation of concerns Business logic is clean, infrastructure logic lives elsewhere. Reusability Same aspect can apply to many beans. Consistency Uniform handling of crosscutting tasks. Non-intrusive No inheritance or modification needed. Testability You can mock target beans without touching proxy logic. \u26a0\ufe0f 12. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 Issue Cause Fix Proxy doesn\u2019t trigger Calling method internally within same class AOP only applies to external calls through proxy Final methods/classes ignored CGLIB can\u2019t override final methods Avoid final on proxied classes/methods Lost annotations on proxies Proxy class doesn\u2019t inherit all metadata Use @Target(ElementType.METHOD) carefully Debug confusion Stack traces show proxy names Use AopUtils.getTargetClass(bean) for clarity \ud83e\udde9 13. AOP and Performance \u00b6 Proxy creation happens only once at startup . Invocation overhead is minimal \u2014 roughly the cost of an extra method call. The real cost comes from your advice logic (e.g., logging, transactions). AOP is designed for coarse-grained interception \u2014 not per-loop micro-optimizations. \ud83e\uddec 14.

One asks, one replies. No memory, no emotion, no hidden channel. Every modern API, website, and cloud service still speaks this simple language. 1. The Core Idea \u2014 Messages Over Time \u00b6 The web began as a document retrieval system . Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t persistent user sessions or apps; it was linking knowledge . HTTP\u2019s design follows that simplicity: Request \u2192 Response \u2192 Done. There\u2019s no shared memory between messages. Each request contains everything the server needs to know \u2014 method, target, headers, optional body. Once the server responds, it forgets you completely. This stateless design made HTTP scalable and robust , but also forgetful \u2014 leading to cookies, tokens, and the whole modern identity stack later on. 2. Anatomy of a Message \u00b6 Both requests and responses share the same skeleton: Start line Headers (blank line) Body (optional) Example \u00b6 GET /books/42 HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Accept: application/json and the server replies: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json {\"title\": \"Dune\"} This minimal structure made HTTP human-readable, debuggable with plain text, and easy to extend (new headers, new methods, new versions). 3. Why Statelessness Was a Feature \u00b6 In the early web, servers handled thousands of independent readers \u2014 scientists browsing papers, not users logging in. Keeping per-user memory would have been: expensive (RAM was scarce) complex (no shared standard for sessions) fragile (every crash loses state) So HTTP\u2019s creators embraced the idea that each request is self-contained . The client must re-introduce itself every time. The brilliance: a server could scale horizontally because any node could answer any request. The downside: the web had no concept of \u201cyou.\u201d 4. From Documents to Applications \u00b6 When the web grew from pages to dynamic apps, statelessness became a challenge. Users wanted continuity \u2014 shopping carts, logins, personalized feeds. That need gave birth to state mechanisms : Cookies \u2014 server remembers you. Tokens \u2014 client proves who it is. But those are patches atop the same protocol. HTTP itself never changed its basic rule: no hidden memory between requests . 5. The Layered Model \u00b6 HTTP sits on top of TCP/IP (and now QUIC for HTTP/3). It doesn\u2019t care how bytes move \u2014 only what the bytes mean. Layer Example Responsibility Application HTTP, FTP, SMTP Meaning of data Transport TCP, UDP, QUIC Reliable delivery Network IP Routing packets Link Ethernet, Wi-Fi Physical transfer This separation made HTTP portable: you can tunnel it through satellites, fiber, or even carrier pigeons if you can keep the packets in order. 6. Versions as Evolution, Not Revolution \u00b6 HTTP/1.1 \u2013 text-based, persistent connections, simple. HTTP/2 \u2013 binary framing, multiplexed streams, header compression. HTTP/3 \u2013 runs on QUIC (UDP), faster handshakes, better resilience. The semantics \u2014 methods, status codes, headers \u2014 remain the same. Only the transport efficiency improves. 7. The Philosophy of Simplicity \u00b6 HTTP\u2019s genius lies in what it doesn\u2019t do: It doesn\u2019t store sessions. It doesn\u2019t dictate data format. It doesn\u2019t maintain connections beyond the request. Because of that minimalism, every higher-level technology \u2014 REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets \u2014 either builds on HTTP or intentionally bends its rules. 8. Mental Model \u00b6 Client \u2192 Request \u2192 Server \u2193 Response Client speaks intention; server returns representation. Everything else \u2014 authentication, caching, security \u2014 is built by adding layers around this simple loop. \ud83e\udded Takeaway \u00b6 HTTP isn\u2019t just a protocol \u2014 it\u2019s a philosophy: Keep communication explicit, simple, and stateless.

See also: HTTP State Reference 1) Why Web State Exists \u00b6 HTTP was designed to be stateless \u2014 every request is a blank slate. Without extra mechanisms, the server can\u2019t tell whether two requests come from the same user. To make web experiences persistent \u2014 logins, carts, dashboards \u2014 we need a state bridge between requests. That bridge has changed over time, but the problem never did. 2) Cookies \u2014 The Original Memory Hack \u00b6 A cookie is a tiny key\u2013value pair that a server asks the browser to keep and send back with future requests. Server \u2192 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123 Browser \u2192 Cookie: sessionId=abc123 Cookies make HTTP feel stateful, but they\u2019re just labels , not memory. The actual data lives on the server , keyed by that label: sessionId=abc123 \u2192 user=Edgaras, cart=3 items Think of it as a coat-check system: You (the browser) keep the ticket. The server keeps your coat (the session data). When you return, you hand in the ticket; the server finds your coat. If either side forgets (cookie cleared or session expired), you start fresh. 3) Why the Client Can\u2019t Be Trusted \u00b6 Cookies are stored client-side, so they can be read, changed, or deleted. That\u2019s why cookies must be protected with strict attributes: Attribute Protects Against Description HttpOnly JavaScript access JS can\u2019t read or modify it Secure Network sniffing Only sent via HTTPS SameSite CSRF attacks Controls cross-site sending Servers must never trust cookie data blindly \u2014 it\u2019s a reference, not proof. 4) The Stateful Model \u2014 Server Remembers You \u00b6 Example: Spring MVC \u00b6 Old-school web applications used server-side sessions . POST /login \u2192 Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=xyz123 Spring stores that session internally: xyz123 \u2192 userId=42, username=\"edgaras\" Next request: GET /profile Cookie: JSESSIONID=xyz123 Spring restores your identity automatically via HttpSession . Code sketch: session . setAttribute ( \"user\" , user ); User user = ( User ) session . getAttribute ( \"user\" ); This model is stateful \u2014 the server remembers each user\u2019s state in memory or a shared store (like Redis). 5) The Stateless Model \u2014 Client Proves Itself \u00b6 Modern REST APIs abandoned server memory. Instead of \u201cthe server remembers you,\u201d we now do \u201cyou prove who you are each time.\u201d Example: Spring Boot (REST API) \u00b6 Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6... The token (e.g., JWT) is: Signed by the server Self-contained (includes user info, expiration, roles) Verifiable without server memory No lookup tables. No HttpSession . Every request is independent and verifiable. This makes scaling simple \u2014 any server can validate the token. 6) Why This Change Happened \u00b6 The shift wasn\u2019t stylistic \u2014 it was infrastructural. Old model (sessions): Works for single servers. Breaks in load-balanced or cloud environments (session stickiness issues). New model (tokens): Works with multiple instances. Stateless and cache-friendly. Portable across APIs, apps, and devices. Tokens are ideal for distributed , multi-client systems. Cookies still shine in browser-native , single-origin web apps. 7) Hybrid World \u2014 Cookies Meet Tokens \u00b6 Many modern systems combine both ideas: Browser clients: store JWT in an HttpOnly cookie for security Mobile / API clients: store JWT manually and send via Authorization header Same token, different transport. Cookies are now often just the delivery vehicle for tokens. 8) Cross-Language Equivalents \u00b6 \ud83e\udde9 Java / Spring \u00b6 Old: HttpSession + JSESSIONID New: JWT / OAuth2 in Authorization header Advanced: WebFlux (reactive, stateless) \u2699\ufe0f Node.js / Express \u00b6 Old: express-session + connect-redis New: jsonwebtoken + stateless JWT validation Middleware-driven auth; typically one-liners \ud83d\udc0d Python \u00b6 Django (classic) : sessionid cookie \u2192 DB-backed session Flask : flask-session (stateful) or flask-jwt-extended (stateless) FastAPI : modern, JWT-first design \u26a1 JavaScript Frontends \u00b6 React / Vue / Angular store tokens in localStorage or cookies Send them as Authorization: Bearer ... Tokens make frontends independent from backend state Each ecosystem faces the same choice: Do we store memory on the server (stateful) or carry proof on the client (stateless)? 9) Concept Table \u2014 The Evolution in One View \u00b6 Era Approach Who Remembers You Stored Where Still Used?

Spring just reflects that same journey: From JSESSIONID \u2192 to JWT \u2192 to OAuth2/OpenID Connect . The evolution wasn\u2019t just technical \u2014 it was philosophical: moving from the server knows you to you can prove who you are. 11) Practical Developer Takeaways \u00b6 Understand cookies and sessions conceptually \u2014 they\u2019re still vital for browsers. Build your APIs statelessly \u2014 each request should carry its own proof (token). Use Spring Security + JWT/OAuth2 as your modern baseline. Learn cross-language equivalents \u2014 they all rhyme with Spring\u2019s concepts.

The browser automatically sends it back with every request to the same origin. Cookies exist because HTTP is stateless \u2014 servers forget who you are between requests. Cookies give the illusion of continuity. Server \u2192 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly Browser \u2192 Cookie: sessionId=abc123 They\u2019re the oldest and most universal state mechanism in HTTP. 2) Anatomy of a Cookie \u00b6 Each cookie line looks like this: Set-Cookie: key=value; Attribute1; Attribute2=... Example \u00b6 Set-Cookie: theme=dark; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Lax The browser then includes it: Cookie: theme=dark 3) Where Cookies Live \u00b6 In browsers: limited (~20 per domain, 4 KB each). By origin: tied to domain + path + scheme (HTTP/HTTPS). Automatically sent: for same-origin requests, no client code needed. 4) Common Attributes and Their Meaning \u00b6 Attribute Purpose Typical Value / Example Domain Which host(s) can receive it Domain=example.com Path Restrict to subpath Path=/api Expires Absolute expiry time Expires=Wed, 16 Oct 2025 07:00:00 GMT Max-Age Relative expiry in seconds Max-Age=3600 Secure Send only via HTTPS Secure HttpOnly Hide from JavaScript HttpOnly SameSite Limit cross-site sending Strict , Lax , None 5) Lifecycle \u00b6 Server sets the cookie via Set-Cookie header. Browser stores it until it expires or user clears it. Browser sends it back in future requests matching domain/path/scheme. Server reads it from Cookie: header. To delete: Set-Cookie: sessionId=deleted; Max-Age=0 6) Session vs Persistent Cookies \u00b6 Type Description Lifetime Session cookie No Expires / Max-Age ; stored in memory Removed when browser closes Persistent cookie Has expiration Survives browser restarts Session cookies \u2192 logins Persistent cookies \u2192 \u201cremember me\u201d 7) Security Essentials \u00b6 \u2705 Always use: \u00b6 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict Key points \u00b6 Secure : no plaintext transmission. HttpOnly : prevents JS theft (XSS). SameSite : defends against CSRF. Don\u2019t store sensitive data directly inside cookies. Avoid overly broad domains ( Domain=.example.com shares across subdomains). 8) SameSite Explained Clearly \u00b6 Mode Behavior Use Case Strict Sent only from same site Most secure (auth cookies) Lax Sent on top-level navigations Default for browsers None Sent everywhere, even cross-site Must combine with Secure ; used for third-party integrations Example: Set-Cookie: auth=abc123; SameSite=None; Secure 9) Cookies in APIs and SPAs \u00b6 Browsers attach cookies automatically only for same-origin requests. When making cross-origin API calls, you must explicitly enable credential sharing. Client (JavaScript) \u00b6 fetch ( \"https://api.example.com/data\" , { credentials : \"include\" }); Server (API) \u00b6 Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.example.com This handshake enables cookie-based auth across origins. 9.5) Modern Alternatives \u00b6 While cookies remain the native way browsers persist state , modern systems often use other approaches \u2014 especially for APIs and mobile apps. Session Tokens \u00b6 Instead of storing a session ID in a cookie, the server issues a token (like a signed string) that the client stores manually (e.g., in localStorage ) and sends in headers such as: Authorization: Bearer <token> JWT (JSON Web Token) \u00b6 A self-contained, signed token that carries claims \u2014 user ID, roles, expiration. Used for stateless authentication \u2014 the server doesn\u2019t need to remember anything. But with power comes danger: once issued, it\u2019s valid until expiry, so revocation is harder . Server-Side Sessions \u00b6 The classic approach \u2014 store session data on the server , and just send a session ID via cookie. Simpler to invalidate, but less scalable in distributed systems. In short: Cookies are the browser-native state glue. Tokens are the API-native evolution. You\u2019ll often see both working together \u2014 cookies wrapping tokens for web clients, tokens alone for APIs and mobile apps. 10) Cookie Storage Alternatives \u00b6 LocalStorage / SessionStorage \u2014 manually managed by JS, not auto-sent. Cookies \u2014 automatic, integrated with HTTP. Use HttpOnly cookies for secrets; use storage APIs for preferences. 11) Practical Example \u2014 Login Flow \u00b6 POST /login \u2192 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict GET /dashboard \u2192 Cookie: sessionId=abc123 Browser sends the cookie automatically; server validates the session. Logout: Set-Cookie: sessionId=; Max-Age=0 12) Debugging & Inspection \u00b6 Using cURL \u00b6 # Show cookies in response curl -I -c cookies.txt https://example.com # Send stored cookies curl -b cookies.txt https://example.com/profile In Browser \u00b6 Open DevTools \u2192 Application \u2192 Cookies to view, edit, or delete. 13) Java & Spring Example \u00b6 Setting \u00b6 ResponseCookie cookie = ResponseCookie . from ( \"sessionId\" , \"abc123\" ) . httpOnly ( true ) . secure ( true ) . sameSite ( \"Strict\" ) . path ( \"/\" ) . maxAge ( Duration . ofHours ( 1 )) . build (); return ResponseEntity . ok () . header ( HttpHeaders .

Keep cookies small. Avoid sensitive info inside. Delete or expire aggressively. Treat them as credentials , not just data. 16) In a Sentence \u00b6 Cookies are the quiet workhorses of the web \u2014 small, loyal, and dumb.

It tells the server who you are and what you\u2019re allowed to do \u2014 nothing more. When you send a request with a token: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6... the server verifies it and uses the claims inside to decide whether you\u2019re authorized. The server doesn\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d you \u2014 it just trusts the math behind the token\u2019s signature. What \u201cStateless\u201d Really Means \u00b6 In old, stateful models (cookies + sessions), the server remembered everything: sessionId=abc123 \u2192 user=Edgaras, cart=3 items, lastPage=/checkout Each request depended on the previous one. That\u2019s stateful \u2014 continuity stored in memory on the server. In a stateless model (tokens): Each request is independent. The server doesn\u2019t hold user memory between requests. If it needs context (cart, settings, history), it queries the database . So \u201cstateless\u201d \u2260 \u201cno persistence.\u201d It means \u201cno in-memory conversation\u201d \u2014 every request brings everything needed to complete itself. What\u2019s Inside a Token \u00b6 Tokens carry only essential data (claims): { \"sub\" : \"42\" , // who you are \"role\" : \"USER\" , // what you can do \"scope\" : \"read:books\" , \"exp\" : 1739678400 // when it expires } The server reads this info, verifies the signature, and makes decisions \u2014 without ever having to recall your previous state. How the Server Sees It \u00b6 Each request is a self-contained event: Receive the token. Verify its signature (check it\u2019s not forged). Validate expiry and audience. Use claims to authorize actions. Fetch any needed data from persistent storage. After responding, it forgets \u2014 no ongoing memory, no session list. Permissions vs. History \u00b6 Tokens don\u2019t store your personal history. They store your authority \u2014 your access rights. Think of it like an access badge : The badge shows your name, department, and which doors you can open. The guard doesn\u2019t know what meetings you had yesterday. If your permissions change, you get a new badge. That\u2019s how modern auth works. Where \u201cState\u201d Actually Lives \u00b6 All lasting data (orders, messages, progress, preferences) is stored in the database , linked to your user ID. When you send a token, the server uses that ID to look up your data as needed. So the real state lives in persistent storage \u2014 not in the session or the token. Core Summary \u00b6 Concept Meaning Token Digital proof of identity and permission Stateless Each request stands alone \u2014 no server memory between them State Stored in the database, not in RAM Cookies Used for stateful sessions (server remembers you) Tokens Used for stateless APIs (you prove yourself each time) Analogy \u00b6 Model Analogy Who Keeps Memory Cookies / Sessions You get a coat-check ticket; the server keeps your coat Server Tokens You carry a signed passport; the server just checks its seal Client In a Sentence \u00b6 Cookies make the web remember you. Tokens make the web verify you. \u2753 Key Q&A \u00b6 1\ufe0f\u20e3 What the token actually does \u00b6 A token doesn\u2019t carry your personal history . It carries proof of identity and permission \u2014 that\u2019s it. When you send it, the server checks: \u201cIs this token valid, and what does it allow this user to do?\u201d It\u2019s like flashing an ID badge to get into a building: The guard (server) doesn\u2019t remember your previous visits. The badge (token) simply proves you\u2019re allowed to be there, maybe with access to certain floors (permissions). So yes \u2014 a token just proves who you are and what you can do . 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What happens to \u201cstate\u201d \u00b6 That\u2019s the stateless part: the server does not keep per-user memory between requests. In a stateful model (like old cookie sessions): The server had a table: sessionId=abc123 \u2192 user=Edgaras, cart=3 items, lastPage=/checkout It used that for context in later requests. In a stateless model (tokens): The server doesn\u2019t keep that table. Each request stands alone: the server authenticates, authorizes, and processes it from scratch using info inside (or derived from) the token. If the server needs extra data \u2014 for example, your shopping cart \u2014 it looks it up from the database , not from memory tied to a session. That\u2019s what \u201cstateless\u201d really means: No in-memory user context between requests. Every request carries all it needs. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s inside the token, then? \u00b6 Usually minimal facts: { \"sub\" : \"42\" , \"role\" : \"USER\" , \"scope\" : \"read:books\" , \"exp\" : 1739678400 } sub \u2192 who you are role / scope \u2192 what you can do exp \u2192 when this proof expires So the token doesn\u2019t tell your story , it tells your authority . 4\ufe0f\u20e3 How the server uses it \u00b6 When you send a request with your token: Server verifies its signature \u2192 confirms it wasn\u2019t forged. Checks expiration . Reads claims ( sub , role , scope ). Uses that info to decide: Can this user access /api/orders/42 ? Is this admin-only? What data should they see? Then the app logic handles whatever you asked \u2014 e.g., reading your orders \u2014 using the user ID from the token to query the database. 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Does the server need history? \u00b6 Not usually. In modern designs, state lives in the database , not the session. If it needs to remember your past actions \u2014 orders, cart, last login \u2014 that\u2019s persisted in the DB keyed by your user ID, not kept in RAM between requests. So \u201cstateless\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno persistence.\u201d It means \u201cno transient memory that ties one HTTP request to the next.\u201d 6\ufe0f\u20e3 Permissions \u2014 what the token \u201cgrants\u201d \u00b6 When an auth system issues a token, it embeds what that token allows . Those are your scopes or roles . Examples: \"scope\" : \"read:orders write:profile\" That\u2019s like saying: \u201cThis badge lets you read orders and update your profile, but not delete users.\u201d The backend checks these scopes to enforce access control. If you later change a user\u2019s permissions, future tokens will reflect that \u2014 but old tokens will keep old scopes until they expire. 7\ufe0f\u20e3 So in summary: \u00b6 Token = identity + permissions , not history. Server = verifier , not rememberer. State (like data or progress) lives in the database , not the session. Stateless means each request can stand alone \u2014 validated and processed without prior context. Scopes/roles inside the token define what you can touch.","title":"Tokens"},{"location":"concepts/networking/http/50-tokens/#understanding-tokens-and-statelessness","text":"","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Understanding Tokens and Statelessness"},{"location":"concepts/networking/http/50-tokens/#what-a-token-really-is","text":"A token is proof of identity and permission , not history.
