# ðŸ§  Knowledge Vault

Two modes, one brain:

- **Cheatsheets** â†’ quick reference while coding
- **Concepts** â†’ deeper understanding and architecture

## ðŸ”Ž How to Use
!!! tip
    Use the search bar for method names, error snippets, or concepts (e.g., `@Transactional`, `N+1`, `Content-Type`).

!!! note "Internal Blueprints"
    Some folders (e.g. `*_meta/blueprint.md*`) are visible intentionally.  
    These files describe how each section (containers, editors, etc.) should evolve â€”  
    theyâ€™re design notes for future structure, not active content.
