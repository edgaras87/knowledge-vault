# 🧩 Spring Core Blueprint — From Reflection to IoC

> **Purpose:**
> This blueprint defines how Spring’s core conceptual notes and cheatsheets fit together — from the raw JVM mechanics to the architecture of IoC and AOP.
> It serves as the *scaffolding* for your future Spring documentation.

## 🌱 Context

The **Spring Framework** sits on top of Java’s reflective and classloading mechanisms.
In your structure, the *JVM-level notes* live under `java/core/`, while the *Spring-specific layers* live under `frameworks/spring/core/`.

So:

```
cheatsheets/languages/java/core/
├─ 00-java-runtime-and-reflection.md
```

are **Java foundations**, not part of Spring itself —
but everything in Spring’s core builds on those concepts.

## 🧭 Conceptual Flow — From Mechanism → Architecture → Abstraction

```
frameworks/spring/core/
├─ reflection-autowired.md       # micro-level: how reflection drives DI
├─ bean-anatomy.md               # entity-level: what a Spring bean is
├─ context-lifecycle.md          # system-level: how the container lives
├─ dependency-injection-patterns.md  # bridge: constructor/setter/field injection
└─ ioc-container.md              # macro-level: inversion of control philosophy
```

### Optional next tier:

```
frameworks/spring/core/
└─ aop-concepts.md               # crosscutting logic & proxy magic
```

## 🧩 Conceptual Layers Explained

| Layer                                      | Focus                     | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Java Core (foundation)**                 | `Class<?>`, `ClassLoader` | JVM mechanisms that enable reflection and dynamic loading.                     |
| **Reflection (micro)**                     | `reflection-autowired.md` | How Spring uses reflection to discover, instantiate, and inject beans.         |
| **Bean Anatomy (entity)**                  | `bean-anatomy.md`         | The structure and lifecycle of a Spring-managed object.                        |
| **Context Lifecycle (system)**             | `context-lifecycle.md`    | How the ApplicationContext orchestrates creation, wiring, and shutdown.        |
| **Dependency Injection Patterns (bridge)** | optional                  | Explains constructor/setter/field injection styles and qualifiers.             |
| **IoC Container (architecture)**           | `ioc-container.md`        | The overarching philosophy: framework controls flow, not user code.            |
| **AOP (extension)**                        | `aop-concepts.md`         | How proxies implement cross-cutting concerns (transactions, caching, logging). |

## 🧬 Knowledge Flow Summary

```
[JVM] → Class<?> → ClassLoader
      ↓
[Spring Micro] → Reflection & @Autowired
      ↓
[Spring Entity] → Bean Anatomy
      ↓
[Spring System] → Context Lifecycle
      ↓
[Bridge] → Dependency Injection Patterns
      ↓
[Spring Architecture] → IoC Container
      ↓
[Spring Extension] → AOP & Proxies
```

## 🧱 Guiding Principles

* Keep **Java core** and **Spring core** clearly separated — Java explains *capability*, Spring explains *usage*.
* Each cheatsheet should link both **up** and **down** the conceptual chain:

  * e.g., `bean-anatomy.md` links *down* to reflection and *up* to context lifecycle.
* For every “how” cheatsheet, create at least one “why” note explaining the rationale (e.g., IoC explains *why* reflection and lifecycle exist).
* When Spring evolves (Micronaut, Quarkus, Jakarta EE), this blueprint will help you **compare architectures** cleanly.

## 🚀 Future Expansion Ideas

| Area                                     | Next natural topic                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Spring Boot internals**                | `spring-boot-autoconfiguration.md` |
| **AOP details**                          | `aop-proxy-mechanics.md`           |
| **Context hierarchy**                    | `applicationcontext-hierarchy.md`  |
| **Bean scopes & lifecycle interactions** | `bean-scope-advanced.md`           |
| **Annotation processing vs reflection**  | `annotation-processing.md`         |

### 🧩 Core Takeaway

> This blueprint maps the intellectual backbone of Spring:
> **Reflection gives it hands, Lifecycle gives it breath, IoC gives it mind.**
> Together, they explain not just *how Spring works*, but *why it exists.*
